title: Running L1 Nodes with Initiad
---

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running an Initia L1 node. It covers everything from system requirements to connecting to the Initia network.

## System Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure your system meets the following minimum requirements:

- **CPU**: 16 cores
- **Memory**: 32GB RAM
- **Storage**: 2 TB NVMe/SSD with Write Throughput > 1000 MiBps
- **Network**: 100 Mbps bandwidth

<Note>
We strongly recommend running Initia nodes on a Linux-based operating system. While it may be possible to run on other operating systems, we have not tested them and cannot guarantee the same environment settings and running conditions.
</Note>

## Installation

There are two ways to install the `initiad` CLI:

### Option 1: Building from Source

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Prerequisites">

Install the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential
```

Also, install the latest version of Go:

```bash
sudo apt install -y golang
```

Verify the installed versions:
```bash
make --version  # Must be 3.8 or later
go version      # Must be 1.22 or later
```

</Step>
<Step title="Build the Daemon">

Clone and build the Initia node:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:initia-labs/initia.git
cd initia
git checkout $TAG  # Replace with desired version
make install
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
initiad version
```

<Warning>
If `initiad` is not found, check your `$PATH` environment variable to ensure it includes `$GOBIN` or `$GOPATH/bin`.
</Warning>

</Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Using Pre-built Binaries

Download pre-built `initiad` binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/initia-labs/initia/releases). Choose the appropriate version for your operating system.

## System Configuration

### File Descriptor Limits

Initia requires a higher number of file descriptors than the default Linux limit. Adjust the system limits by adding the following to `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

```bash
* soft nofile 65535
* hard nofile 65535
```

## Node Setup

### Initialization

Initialize your node with a moniker (a human-readable name):

```bash
initiad init <moniker>
```

Note that

- Moniker must contain only ASCII characters
- Maximum length is 70 characters 
- The default home directory is `${HOME}/.initia`
- To use a different directory, add `--home <YOUR_INITIA_HOME>` to commands

<Warning>
Your private key is generated during initialization and stored in `${HOME}/.initia/config/priv_validator_key.json`. 
**IMPORTANT**: Always backup your private key, especially for validator nodes. Loss of the private key may result in permanent node inaccessibility.
</Warning>

### Network Configuration

#### Endpoints

An Initia node comes with multiple endpoint that you can either enable or disable.

| Endpoint | Description | Configuration File |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| REST | RESTful HTTP API | `~/.initia/config/app.toml` |
| gRPC/gRPC-WEB | gRPC API | `~/.initia/config/app.toml` |
| RPC | Tendermint/CometBFT API | `~/.initia/config/config.toml` |
| P2P | Gossip P2P Network | `~/.initia/config/config.toml` |

<Info>
Validator nodes are not recommended to expose these endpoints publicly.
</Info>

#### Configuration Examples

1. **API Configuration** (`~/.initia/config/app.toml`):
```toml
[api]
enable = true
swagger = true
address = "tcp://0.0.0.0:1317"

[grpc]
enable = true
address = "0.0.0.0:9090"

[grpc-web]
enable = true
address = "0.0.0.0:9091"
```

2. **RPC and P2P Configuration** (`~/.initia/config/config.toml`):
```toml
[rpc]
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"

[p2p]
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656"
```

### External Address Configuration

To allow external nodes to connect to your node, configure the external address in `config.toml`:

```toml
[p2p]
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656"
external_address = "YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:26656"
```

You can automatically set your public IP using:
```bash
sed -i -e 's/external_address = \"\"/external_address = \"'$(curl httpbin.org/ip | jq -r .origin)':26656\"/g' ~/.initia/config/config.toml
```

## Connecting to Initia Network

To fully connect to the network, you first need to first download the genesis file and configure your peers, and sync the node.

<Note>
You can find information on the genesis file, peers, and state sync for the network you want to join in the [networks page](/resources/developer/networks/initia-l1)
</Note>

### Genesis File

To start syncing the node, you first need to download the genesis file.

```bash
wget $GENESIS_FILE_URL -O $HOME/.initia/config/genesis.json
```

### Network Configuration

Once the genesis file is downloaded, you can configure the persistent peers in `~/.initia/config/config.toml`:

```bash
persistent_peers = "peer1@ip1:port1,peer2@ip2:port2"
```

Replace `peer1@ip1:port1,peer2@ip2:port2` with the list of peers for the network you want to join.

### State Sync & Snapshots

To then sync the node, you can use the [state sync](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/v0.34.x/spec/p2p/messages/state-sync.md) feature.

## Running as a Service (Optional)

To run Initia as a system service, create a `initiad.service` file in `/etc/systemd/system`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=initiad

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/usr/bin/initiad start
Restart=on-abort
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=initiad
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once the service file is created, you can enable and start the service:
```bash
systemctl enable initiad
systemctl start initiad
```

To then see the logs, you can use the following commands: 
```bash
journalctl -t initiad    # View current logs
journalctl -t initiad -f # Follow logs in real-time
journalctl -t initiad -n <number> # View last N lines
```
