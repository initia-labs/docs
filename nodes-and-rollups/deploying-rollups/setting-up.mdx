## Install Dependencies

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Install Go (v1.22)" icon="golang">
The rollup daemon is built using [Go](https://golang.org/), a performant, easy-to-learn, and expressive programming language that is widely used in distributed systems.

To install Go, follow the instructions on the [Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

To verify your installation, run the following command in your terminal
```bash
go version
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Install Docker" icon="docker">
All components of the rollup stack offers 2 deployment methods; building and running from source and through the provided [Docker](https://docker.com/) image.

For those looking to use Docker, following the instructions to install from the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

To verify that Docker is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
docker version
```

## Download Rollup Binary

Once we have successfully installed the core dependencies, we can download the rollup binary.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Shell">
First, specify the rollup VM and version you want to use:

```sh
export VM=[vm-type] # one of "move", "wasm", or "evm"
export MINITIA_VERSION="0.2.16" # replace with other version as necessary
```

Next, clone the corresponding rollup Git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/initia-labs/mini$VM.git
```

Once the clone is complete, navigate to the appropriate directory (minimove, miniwasm, or minievm) and check out the rollup version specified above. Finally, build the rollup CLI.

```sh
cd mini$VM
git checkout v$MINITIA_VERSION
make install
```

Verify the installation of the rollup image. If the process was completed successfully, the version number should match `$MINITIA_VERSION`:

```sh
minitiad version
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Docker">
First, specify the rollup VM and version you want to use:

```sh
export VM=[vm-type] # one of "move", "wasm", or "evm"
export MINITIA_VERSION="0.2.16" # replace with other version as necessary
```

Pull the rollup container version

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/initia-labs/miniwasm:v$MINITIA_VERSION
```

Verify the installation of the rollup container. If the process was completed successfully, the version number should match $MINITIA_VERSION:

```sh
docker run ghcr.io/initia-labs/miniwasm:v$MINITIA_VERSION minitiad version
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Starting the Rollup

Once the `minitiad` CLI is functional, the following steps depends on how you want to run or test your rollup

1. **Standalone rollup (Testnet/Local Only):** A minimal, streamlined setup ideal for testing rollup functionality and deploying or integrating with it. It does not include IBC or OPinit bridges. See [Deploying a Standalone Rollup](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/rollup-deployment/deploying-standalone-rollup)

2. **Run with IBC and OPinit Bots:** The full rollup setup with all of the components when you want to connect to other rollups or Initia L1. See [Rollup Full Deployment](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/rollup-deployment/introduction)
