title: Deploying a Standalone Rollup
---

Rollups can be run as a standalone rollup chain. While we strongly recommend the full setup using OPinit bots and IBC as outlined above, this setup can be useful for developers who want to quickly test the core rollup functionality and deploy contracts on top of it.

## Setting up the Rollup

Before we configure the rollup, choose and enter the chain ID, moniker and denom that you'd like to use for your rollup. 

- `CHAIN_ID`: a unique identifier for your blockchain that is used to identify the network, prevent cross-chain transaction replay attacks, identify genesis files, amongst other things.
- `MONIKER`: a human-readable name for your node.
- `DENOM`: the default token denomination for your chain.

```sh
export CHAIN_ID=minitia
export MONIKER=operator
export DENOM=umin
```

Then, run the following command to initialize the rollup. This includes the operator/sequencer, rollup genesis, and configuration files.

<CodeGroup>
```sh CLI
minitiad init $MONIKER --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --denom $DENOM
```
```sh Docker
Coming Soon
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, we need to create a key that'll be used as the minitia's operator (aka. sequencer, validator)

<CodeGroup>
```sh CLI
export KEY_NAME=operator

minitiad keys add $KEY_NAME
```
```sh Docker
Coming Soon
```
</CodeGroup>

The above command will create a key for you and and save it to your device's keyring. We recommend writing down the mnemonic somewhere safe as there is no way to show it again.

Once the key is ready, we proceed to modify the minitia's genesis file in 2 ways:

1. give initial gas token balances to the `operator` account.
2. add the `operator` account as the minitia's sequencer

First, we give the `operator` account an initial gas balance to be able to send transactions.

```sh
minitiad genesis add-genesis-account $KEY_NAME 10000000000$DENOM
```

Repeat the command for any additional accounts that you'd like to fund. We then need to set the `operator` account as the minitia's sequencer.

```sh
minitiad genesis add-genesis-validator $KEY_NAME
```

Finally, we run and start the rollup:

```sh
minitiad start
```

Your rollup should now be producing blocks
