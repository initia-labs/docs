Once a rollup is up and running with the initial connections established, the next step is to set up the OPinit bots. These bots are crucial for maintaining and facilitating interactions between Initia (L1) and rollup (L2). Currently, there are two main bots responsible for different tasks:

- [Executor](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/opinit-bots/executor.mdx): Handles token transfers, output proposals, and batch submissions.
- [Challenger](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/opinit-bots/challenger.mdx): Monitors and validates outputs, deposits, and oracle updates to ensure system integrity.

These bots play key roles in ensuring the secure operation of rollup within the Initia ecosystem. Each bot performs essential functions to manage data consistency, security, and correctness in the interactions between the two blockchains.

For more details on the specific functions of each bot and the overall OPinit stack, refer to each section in the links above.

<Warning>
For testing purposes, OPinit bots can be hosted on the same machine as your rollup service.
However, for production or mainnet environments, we highly recommend hosting your OPinit bots on separate machines to ensure optimal performance and security.
