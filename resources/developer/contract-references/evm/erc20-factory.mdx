GitHub: [ERC20Factory](https://github.com/initia-labs/initia-evm-contracts/blob/main/src/ERC20Factory.sol)

## Overview

The `ERC20Factory` contract is designed to create new InitiaERC20 tokens and register them with the MiniEVM's ERC20Registry

## Predeployed contract

`ERC20Factory` is deployed on the chain at a fixed address as part of its bootstrapping process. 

You can retrieve the contract address via a GET request to an example endpoint like 
`https://lcd.minievm-2.initia.xyz` (replace it with your own REST endpoint if needed):

```bash
curl -X GET "https://lcd.minievm-2.initia.xyz/minievm/evm/v1/contracts/erc20_factory" -H "accept: application/json"
```

The response will be similar to:

```json
{
  "address": "0xf36924c9C2aD25d73c43F6aC59BB6D06BC944D93"
}
```
