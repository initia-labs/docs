## Overview

The `InitiaERC20` contract is an implementation of the ERC20 token standard with additional functionalities such as access control, registry integration, and support for Cosmos blockchain interactions. This contract inherits from multiple contracts including `IERC20`, `Ownable`, `ERC20Registry`, `ERC165`, and `ERC20ACL`.

<Warning>
The InitiaERC20 contract is only meant to be used by the [ERC20Factory](/resources/developer/contract-references/evm/erc20-factory) contract. It is not meant to be used directly and does not have the necessary modifiers for full compatibility with the MiniEVM.

To deploy a custom ERC20 token, developers should use the [InitiaCustomERC20](/resources/developer/contract-references/evm/initia-custom-erc20) contract instead.
</Warning>

## Inheritance

-     `IERC20`: Interface for ERC20 standard functions.
-     `Ownable`: Provides ownership control.
-     `ERC20Registry`: Handles ERC20 registry functionalities.
-     `ERC165`: Supports interface identification.
-     `ERC20ACL`: Provides access control mechanisms.

## Events

-     `Transfer`: Emitted when tokens are transferred from one address to another.
  - `address indexed from`: The address sending the tokens.
  - `address indexed to`: The address receiving the tokens.
  - `uint256 value`: The amount of tokens transferred.

-     `Approval`: Emitted when an address approves another address to spend tokens on its behalf.
  - `address indexed owner`: The address granting the approval.
  - `address indexed spender`: The address receiving the approval.
  - `uint256 value`: The amount of tokens approved.

## State Variables

-     `mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf`: Tracks the balance of each address.
-     `mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance`: Tracks the allowance each address has given to another address.
-     `string public name`: The name of the token.
-     `string public symbol`: The symbol of the token.
-     `uint8 public decimals`: The number of decimals the token uses.
-     `uint256 public totalSupply`: The total supply of the token.

## Constructor

Initializes the contract with the token's name, symbol, and decimals.

```solidity
constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint8 _decimals) {
    name = _name;
    symbol = _symbol;
    decimals = _decimals;
}
