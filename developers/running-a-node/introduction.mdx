The following guide will walk you through the steps of how to run an Initia node and optionally to join the Initia network as a validator.

<Warning>
  This guide has been tested agains Linux distributions only. While it might be possible to run an
  Initia node on other operating systems, the process is not as straightforward and may require
  additional configuration.
</Warning>

## Hardware Requirements

We recommend the following hardware configurations for running and Initia node:

| Network                | CPU      | Memory   | Disk                          | Bandwidth |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | --------- |
| Testnet (initiation-1) | 16 cores | 32GB RAM | 2TB NVMe SSD, 1000 MiBps IOPS | 1000Mbps  |

## Dependencies

<Accordion title="Install Go (v1.22)" icon="golang">
The Initia node is built using [Go](https://golang.org/), a performant, easy-to-learn, and expressive programming language that is widely used in distributed systems.

To install Go, follow the instructions on the [Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

To verify your installation, run the following command in your terminal

```bash
