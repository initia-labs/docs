## Install and Update Required Packages

```sh
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get upgrade -y && \
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential curl wget jq
```

## Install the Initia Daemon

Then, we need to clone the Initia repository and checkout the latest or desired version.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/initia-labs/initia
cd initia
git checkout [version]
```

Once we have the correct version, we can build the binary. This will install the `initiad` executable to your `GOPATH` environment variable.

```sh
make install
```

To verify that the installation was successful, run the following command:


```sh
initiad version --long
```

If installed correctly, this should give you an output similar to the following:

```sh
name: initia
server_name: initiad
version: v0.1.0-beta.14-3-gfb27858
commit: fb278587666dde8ae2d46c51a9f8a760c8d0c3c2
build_tags: netgo,ledger
go: go version go1.20.1 darwin/amd64
build_deps:
- cosmossdk.io/api@v0.2.6
- cosmossdk.io/core@v0.5.1
```

<Tip>
If you get a `initiad: command not found" message from running `initiad`, you may need to add the `GOPATH/bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
</Tip>

## Increases File Descriptors Limit

Linux systems by default set the maximum number of file descriptors that can be opened by a process to 1024. It is recomemneded that you increase this amount.

To do so, modify `/etc/security/limits.conf` to increase the amount. The `nofile` is the number of files a process may open at a time.

<Tip>
If you are using a non-root user, replace `*` with the username of the user.
</Tip>

```sh limits.conf
* soft nofile 65535
* hard nofile 65535
```

## Register Initia as a Service

While you can run your initia node manually, it is recomemnded that you register it as a Linux service. This will allow you to more easily manage your node and also to run it as a background process.

To do so, create a file at `/etc/systemd/system/initiad.service` with the contents below. replace

- **User:** with the accout name that you will be running `initiad` from
- **ExecStart:** with the full path to the `initiad` binary + `start` command

```sh initiad.service
[Unit]
Description=initiad

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/usr/bin/initiad start
Restart=on-abort
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=initiad
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once the file is created, run the following command to enable the service and start it:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable initiad
```

<Note>
Whenever you modify the `initiad.service` file after you enabled it, you need to run the following commands first before the changes are applied

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart initiad
```
