## Overview

The `ERC20ACL` contract provides access control mechanisms for ERC20 token operations. It includes modifiers to restrict certain actions based on conditions such as whether an address is a module address or a blocked address.

## Constants

### `CHAIN_ADDRESS`

The address of the chain signer.

```solidity
address constant CHAIN_ADDRESS = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001;
```

## Modifiers

### `onlyChain`

Restricts the function to be called only by the chain signer.

```solidity
modifier onlyChain() {
    require(msg.sender == CHAIN_ADDRESS, "ERC20: caller is not the chain");
    _;
}
```

### `burnable`

Restricts the function to ensure the sender is not a module address.

```solidity
modifier burnable(address from) {
    require(!COSMOS_CONTRACT.is_module_address(from), "ERC20: burn from module address");
    _;
}
```

#### Parameters

| Name    | Type      | Description                      |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| `from`  | `address` | The address to check             |

### `mintable`

Restricts the function to ensure the recipient is not a blocked address.

```solidity
modifier mintable(address to) {
    require(!COSMOS_CONTRACT.is_blocked_address(to), "ERC20: mint to blocked address");
    _;
}
```

#### Parameters

| Name    | Type      | Description                      |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| `to`    | `address` | The address to check             |

### `transferable`

Restricts the function to ensure the recipient is not a blocked address.

```solidity
modifier transferable(address to) {
    require(!COSMOS_CONTRACT.is_blocked_address(to), "ERC20: transfer to blocked address");
    _;
}
```

#### Parameters

| Name    | Type      | Description                      |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| `to`    | `address` | The address to check             |
