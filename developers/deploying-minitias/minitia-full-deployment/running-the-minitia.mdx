title: Running the Minitia
---

After the `minitiad` daemon is installed, either through compiling the source code or using the provided Docker container from the previous step, we can proceed to launch the minitia.

The minitaid CLI provides a utility launch command to simplify the initial setup sequences of minitia. It is designed to automate the process of setting up and configuring your minitia environment.

## Preparing the Configuration File

The launch command allows customization of the minitia and related configurations and parameters through a `config.json` file.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="l1_config">
This specifies the configuration of the Initial L1 that the minitia will be connecting to.

| Field       | Description                                                | Example                                                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chain_id`  | the chain ID of the L1 to connect to                       | `initiation-1`                                                 |
| `rpc_url`   | The Initia L1 RPC URL to use when sending transactions.    | [https://initia-testnet-rpc.polkachu.com:443](https://initia-testnet-rpc.polkachu.com:443) |
| `gas_prices`| The minimum gas prices and gas denom                       | `0.15uinit`                                                    |

  "gas_prices": "0.15move/944f8dd8dc49f96c25fea9849f16436dcfa6d564eec802f3ef7f8bfbe5c16dbd"
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="l2_config">
This defines the configurations for the minitia being deployed.

| Field      | Description                                      | Example     |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `chain_id` | the chain ID of the minitia being deployed.      | minitia-1   |
| `denom`    | the base token denom to use for the minitia      | umin        |
| `moniker`  | the identifier to use for the sequencer/operator account | operator |

Example:

```json
"l2_config": {
  "chain_id": "minitia-XDzNjd-1",
  "denom": "umin",
  "moniker": "operator"
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="op_bridge">

These specify the behavior of the output and batch submission components of the OPInit stack.

| Field                          | Description                                                                          | Example                                       |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `output_submission_start_time` | Specifies the start time for output submission                                       | 2024-05-08T12:23:15.488692+09:00              |

| `output_finalization_period`   | The time period, in nanoseconds, required for an output to remain before it is considered finalized and immutable | 3600000000000                                 |
| `batch_submission_target`      | The chain where the batch submission output should be sent after being processed. Currently supports either Initia L1 and Celestia | l1                                          |

Example:

```json
"op_bridge": {
  "output_submission_start_time": "2024-05-08T12:23:15.488692+09:00",
  "output_submission_interval": 3600000000000,
  "output_finalization_period": 3600000000000,
  "batch_submission_target": "l1"
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="system_keys">
The system keys define the address and mnemonic pairs that will be used for the minitia's main operations. These include:

- Validator
- Bridge Executor
- Output Submitter
- Batch Submitter
- Challenger

Example:

```json
"system_keys": {
  "validator": {
    "address": "init12z54lfqgp7zapzuuk2m4h6mjz84qzca8j0wm4x",
    "mnemonic": "digital kingdom slim fall cereal aspect expose trade once antique"
  },
  "bridge_executor": {
    "address": "init13skjgs2x96c4sk9mfkfdzjywm7516wy63j5gyn",
    "mnemonic": "junk aunt group member rebel dinosaur will trial jacket core club"
  },
  "output_submitter": {
    "address": "init1f4lu0ze9c7zegrrjfpymjvztucqz48z3cy8p5f"
  },
  "batch_submitter": {
    "address": "init1hqv5xqt7lckdj9p5kfp2q5auc5z37pvyt4d72"
  },
  "challenger": {
    "address": "init1gn0yjtcm92y27c0z84ratxf6juy691pln6u88"
  }
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="genesis_accounts">
These specify accounts that will be created during genesis. By default, these will be the addresses corresponding to each of the system keys. But other accounts can also be added and given token balances at genesis.

Example:

```json
"genesis_accounts": [
  {
    "address": "init12z54lfqgp7zapzuuk2m4h6mjz84qzca8j0wm4x",
    "coins": "100000000umin"
  },
  {
    "address": "init13skjgs2x96c4sk9mfkfdzjywm7516wy63j5gyn"
  },
  {
    "address": "init1f4lu0ze9c7zegrrjfpymjvztucqz48z3cy8p5f"
  },
  {
    "address": "init1hqv5xqt7lckdj9p5kfp2q5auc5z37pvyt4d72"
  },
  {
    "address": "init1gn0yjtcm92y27c0z84ratxf6juy691pln6u88"
  }
]
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Examples of the minimal and full `config.json` file content can be found [here](https://github.com/initia-labs/examples).

<Warning>
**Funding System Keys**: Before launching, we must fund the Bridge Executor, Output Submitter, and Batch Submitter accounts with gas tokens on Initia L1 to enable them to send transactions.
</Warning>

## Launching the Minitia

Once we have a config file ready and the accounts funded, we can proceed to the launch process.

```bash
export L1_CHAIN_ID=initiation-1 # replace with the desired Initia L1 chain ID
minitiad launch $L1_CHAIN_ID --with-config config.json
```

If you did not specify the bridge executor mnemonic and address in the config.json file, the launch command will prompt you for this information during the setup process.

If the launch is successful, you should get an output similar to the one below:

```
############################################
Artifact written to
* /Users/initia/.minitia/artifacts/config.json
* /Users/initia/.minitia/artifacts/artifact.json

{
 "BRIDGE_ID": "70",
 "EXECUTOR_L1_MONITOR_HEIGHT": "1370793",
 "EXECUTOR_L2_MONITOR_HEIGHT": "49"
}
```

Once the launch steps successfully completes, two artifact files will be generated in the directory `$HOME/.minitia/artifacts`

- `config.json`: The complete config file. Any previously omitted fields have been filled with default or automatically generated values.
- `artifacts.json`: Stores the output artifact from the launch process


## Starting the Minitia

Once the bootstrapping launch step is complete, we can now start running our minitia.

```
minitiad start
```

This process will begin running the minitia and producing blocks.

## Conclusion

With these steps complete, your minitia is now ready for testing and development. To continue setting up the OPInit bridge and bots, enable IBC transfers, and enabling oracles, follow the subsequent instructions in this section.
