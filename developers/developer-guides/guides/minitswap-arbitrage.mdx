## Arbitrage Opportunity: IBC opINIT Price Lower than INIT Price in Minitswap

In the Minitswap Virtual Pool, if the amount of IBC opINIT exceeds INIT, the price of IBC opINIT will be lower than INIT. 

In this case, users can exchange IBC opINIT for INIT by undergoing a 7-day challenge period on their behalf.

To do this, the following steps can be taken:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Swap INIT to IBC opINIT in Minitswap">
    When an arbitrage opportunity arises in a specific L2's Virtual Pool within Minitswap, where the price of INIT is higher than that of IBC opINIT, users may swap INIT for IBC opINIT. 
    
    During this process, it is essential to take into account both swap fees and slippage.
    
    See [Minitswap swap](/developers/developer-guides/integrating-initia-apps/minitswap#swap).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Transfer IBC opINIT to L2 by IBC Bridge">
    Transfer the swapped IBC opINIT to the appropriate L2 through the IBC Bridge.
    
    Note that if Milkyway's IBC opINIT was swapped, the assets must be transferred to the Milkyway L2. 
    
    Upon reaching L2, IBC opINIT will be converted to opINIT. 

    See [IBC bridge token transfer](/developers/developer-guides/guides/interchain-message#transferring-tokens-via-ibc).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Withdraw opINIT">
    To transfer opINIT to L1 using the OP Bridge, initiate a withdrawal by executing `MsgInitiateTokenWithdrawal`.

    See [OP bridge withdrawal](/developers/developer-guides/guides/interchain-message#withdrawing-tokens-from-minitia-to-initia)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Finalize opINIT">
    After the 7-day Challenge Period, finalize the withdrawal process to exchange IBC opINIT for INIT by executing `MsgFinalizeWithdraw`.

    See [OP bridge finalization](/developers/developer-guides/guides/interchain-message#finalizing-token-withdrawal-on-initia)
    </Step>

## Arbitrage Opportunity: INIT Price Lower than IBC opINIT Price  in Minitswap

In the Minitswap Virtual Pool, if the amount of INIT exceeds IBC opINIT, the price of INIT will be lower than IBC opINIT.

Users can exchange INIT for IBC opINIT through several bridge transfers.

To do this, the following steps can be taken:

<Note>
Generally, INIT can always be converted 1:1 to IBC opINIT, which means that in the Minitswap pool, the price of IBC opINIT is usually lower than that of INIT.

    <Step title="Transfer opINIT to L1 by IBC">
    opINIT transferred to L2 is moved to L1 through the IBC bridge. 
    
    The opINIT moved to L1 will be converted to IBC opINIT.
    
    See [IBC bridge token transfer](/developers/developer-guides/guides/interchain-message#transferring-tokens-via-ibc).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Swap IBC opINIT to INIT in Minitswap">
    IBC opINIT received in L1 is exchanged for INIT in the Minitswap pool.
