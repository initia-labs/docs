This endpoint returns the latest price data for a given `baseCurrency` and `quoteCurrency` pair. Note that `baseCurrency` and `quoteCurrency` must be a pair supported and found in the [supported feeds](/developers/developer-guides/tools/oracles/connect/fetching-prices-from-api/getting-supported-feeds) endpoint, and combinations are not supported.

For example, even if `BTC`/`USD` and `ETH`/`USD` are supported, `BTC`/`ETH` is not supported.
