title: Bootstrapping Initia Node
---

Setting up a Cosmos-SDK based node has traditionally been a complex process requiring multiple steps:
- Locating the correct repository and version of the node binary compatible with your target network
- Either cloning and building the source code or downloading a pre-built binary from the release page
- Configuring the node with appropriate `config.toml` and `app.toml` files, which involves:
    - Setting correct values for `min_gas_price`, `seeds`, and `persistent_peers`
    - Navigating through numerous other parameters that rarely need modification
- Finding and implementing the correct genesis file to sync with the network
- Setting up cosmovisor for automatic updates or manually maintaining the node binary

`Weave` streamlines this entire process into a simple command.

## Initialize your node

```bash
weave initia init
```
This command guides you through the node setup process, taking you from an empty directory to a fully synced node ready for operation.
Once complete, you can run the node using `weave initia start`.

<Note>
For advanced configuration options, refer to the [Configuration Guide](/nodes-and-rollups/running-a-node/manual-setup/node-configuration) and modify the node's configuration files (located by default at `~/.initia/<app.toml|config.toml>`).
</Note>

<Info>
By default, all data and configuration files are stored in `~/.initia`. You can specify a different location using the `--initia-dir` flag followed by your preferred path.
