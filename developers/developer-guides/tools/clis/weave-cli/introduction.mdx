Weave is a specialized CLI tool designed to simplify the workflow of working
 with Initia and its Interwoven Rollups. Instead of dealing with multiple tools and extensive documentation,
 developers can use a single command-line interface for the entire development and deployment workflow.
 
Its primary purpose is to solve several key challenges:
1. **Developer Experience:** Most CLIs in the market are not designed with the developer experience in mind. They are either too complex or too simple that it cannot handle the technical nuances. 

    Weave changes that completely. Not only it consolidates multiple complex operations into a single CLI tool, but it also changes how you interact with the tool to setup your configuration.
2. **Infrastructure Management:** `Weave` can handles all critical infrastructure components within the Interwoven Rollup ecosystem:
    - Initia node setup and management (not just simple configuration setup, but also state-syncing and upgrade management)
    - Rollup deployment and configuration
    - OPinit bots setup for the Optimistic bridge
    - IBC Relayer setup between Initia L1 and your Rollup
    - and many more to come
3. **Built for both local development and production deployments:**
    - Weave provides an interactive guided setup experience to walk you through infrastructure configuration step-by-step
    - For automated deployments, a configuration file can be parsed to provision your entire infrastructure without interaction

## How experience with Weave is different
Weave changes the game in terms of developer experience. Here are some of the key features that make it stand out:
1. **Ability to go back to the previous step:** 
    `Weave` allows you to go back to the previous step in the setup process by pressing `Ctrl + Z`. This is particularly useful when you make a mistake in the setup process and need to correct it.
2. **Tooltip support in each step:**
    Users can toggle Tooltip on and off in each step by pressing `Ctrl + T` to get more information about the current step they are on.
    
    We give you the right amount of information at the right time. Less time spent on googling and finding the information you need. 
3. **Simple service management:**
    `Weave` provides a simple command to start, stop, restart a service just like how you would do it with `systemctl` or `launchctl`. It also provides a `log` command to view the logs of the service.

    In essence, every infra-service you setup can be managed with the following commands:
    ```bash
    weave <service-name> start, stop, restart, log
    ```
