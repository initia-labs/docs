Weave is a specialized CLI tool designed to simplify the workflow of working
 with Initia and its Interwoven Rollups. Instead of dealing with multiple tools and extensive documentation,
 developers can use a single command-line interface for the entire development and deployment workflow.
 
Its primary purpose is to solve several key challenges:
1. Developer Experience: Developers and operators always stuck with bad UX of existing CLI tools. Weave changes that completely. 
Not only it consolidates multiple complex operations into a single CLI tool, but it also changes how you interact with the tool to setup your configuration.
2. Infrastructure Management: It handles all critical infrastructure components within the Interwoven Rollup ecosystem:
    - Initia node setup and management (not just simple configuration setup, but also state-syncing and upgrade management)
    - Rollup deployment and configuration
    - OPinit bots setup for the Optimistic bridge
    - IBC Relayer setup between Initia L1 and your Rollup
    - and more to come!
3. Built for both local development and production deployments: 
    - Weave provides an interactive guided setup experience to walk you through infrastructure configuration step-by-step
    - For automated deployments, it can parse a configuration file to provision your entire infrastructure with a single command
