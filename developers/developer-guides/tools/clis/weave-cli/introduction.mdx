Weave is a CLI tool designed to make working with Initia and its Interwoven Rollups easier. Instead of dealing with multiple tools and extensive documentation,
developers can use a single command-line interface for the entire development and deployment workflow.

Its primary purpose is to solve several key challenges:

1. **Infrastructure Management:** Weave can handles all critical infrastructure components within the Interwoven Rollup ecosystem:
   - Initia node setup and management (including state sync and chain upgrade management)
   - Rollup deployment and configuration
   - OPinit bots setup for the Optimistic bridge
   - IBC Relayer setup between Initia L1 and your Rollup
2. **Built for both local development and production deployments:** Weave provides
   - Interactive guided setup for step-by-step configuration and
   - Configuration file support for automated deployments
3. **Developer Experience:** Not only it consolidates multiple complex operations into a single CLI tool, but it also changes how you interact with the tool to setup your configuration.

## How experience with Weave is different

Here are some of the key features that make it stand out:

1. **Tooltip support in each step:**
   Users can toggle Tooltip on and off in each step by pressing `Ctrl + T` to get more information about the current step they are on.

   We give you the right amount of information at the right time. Less time spent on googling and finding the information you need.

2. **Ability to go back to the previous step (for most steps):**
   Weave allows you to go back to the previous step in the setup process by pressing `Ctrl + Z`. This is particularly useful when you make a mistake in the setup process and need to correct it. Please note that this is not available for all steps.

3. **Simple service management:**
   Weave provides a simple command to start, stop, restart a service just like how you would do it with `systemctl` or `launchctl`. It also provides a `log` command to view the logs of the service.

   In essence, every infra-service you setup can be managed with the following commands:

   ```bash
   weave <service-name> start, stop, restart, log
   ```
