### Download pre-built binaries

## Quick Setup
To get started with `Weave`, run
```bash
weave init
```
It will ask you to setup the [Gas Station](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/gas-station) account and ask which infrastructure you want to setup.
After that, Weave will guide you through the setup process step-by-step. 

<Note>
We recommend reading the [Gas Station](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/gas-station) section to understand the purpose and usage of the Gas Station before proceeding.
