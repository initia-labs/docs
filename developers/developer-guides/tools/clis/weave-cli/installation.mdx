## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step title="Get Weave Binary">
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Build from source">
                ```bash
                git clone https://github.com/initia-labs/weave.git
                cd weave
                make install
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Download pre-built binaries">
                Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/initia-labs/weave/releases) page and download the binary for your operating system.
                <Warning>
                    Make sure to add the binary to your PATH environment variable so that you can run `weave` from anywhere.
                </Warning>
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify Installation">
        ```bash
        weave version
        ```
        This should return the version of the Weave binary you have installed.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Quick Start">
        To get started with Weave, run
        ```bash
        weave init
        ```
        It will ask you to setup the [Gas Station](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/gas-station) account and ask which infrastructure you want to setup.
        After that, Weave will guide you through the setup process step-by-step.

        <Note>
        We recommend reading the [Gas Station](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/gas-station) section to understand the purpose and usage of the Gas Station before proceeding.
