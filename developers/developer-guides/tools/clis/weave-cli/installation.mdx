<Steps>
    <Step title="Get Weave Binary">
<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS
brew install initia-labs/tap/weave
```
```bash Linux (AMD64)
VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/initia-labs/weave/releases/latest | grep '"tag_name":' | cut -d'"' -f4 | cut -c 2-)
wget https://github.com/initia-labs/weave/releases/download/v$VERSION/weave-$VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf weave-$VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
```bash Linux (ARM64)
VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/initia-labs/weave/releases/latest | grep '"tag_name":' | cut -d'"' -f4 | cut -c 2-)
wget https://github.com/initia-labs/weave/releases/download/v$VERSION/weave-$VERSION-linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xvf weave-$VERSION-linux-arm64.tar.gz
```
```bash From Source
git clone https://github.com/initia-labs/weave.git
cd weave
git checkout tags/v0.0.2
VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/initia-labs/weave/releases/latest | grep '"tag_name":' | cut -d'"' -f4 | cut -c 2-)
git checkout tags/v$VERSION
make install
```
</CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify Installation">
        ```bash
        weave version
        ```
        This should return the version of the Weave binary you have installed.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Quick Start">
        To get started with Weave, run
        ```bash
        weave init
        ```
        It will ask you to setup the [Gas Station](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/gas-station) account and ask which infrastructure you want to setup.
        After that, Weave will guide you through the setup process step-by-step.

        <Note>
        We recommend reading the [Gas Station](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/gas-station) section to understand the purpose and usage of the Gas Station before proceeding.
        </Note>
