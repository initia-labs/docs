title: Running IBC Relayer
---

<Warning>
Weave v0.3.0 or later is required. You can upgrade to the latest version by running `weave upgrade`.
</Warning>

An IBC relayer is a software component that facilitates communication between two distinct blockchain networks that support the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

It is required for built-in oracle, Minitswap, and other cross-chain services to function with your rollup.

Weave currently only supports Rapid relayer configuration generation. It will support running the rapid relayer directly in the future.


<Note>
For more detailed information about Rapid relayer, see the [Rapid relayer documentation](https://github.com/initia-labs/rapid-relayer).
</Note>

## Setting up

```bash
weave relayer init
```

This command will guide you through 2 major parts of the relayer setup:
- Setting up networks and channels to relay messages between
- Setting up the account responsible for relaying messages


For the former, Weave will present you with three options:
1. Configure channels between Initia L1 and a whitelisted Rollup (those available in [Initia Registry](https://github.com/initia-labs/initia-registry))
2. Configure using artifacts from `weave rollup launch` (recommended for users who have just launched their rollup)
3. Configure manually

As for the latter, Weave will ask whether you want to use the OPinit Challenger bot account for the relayer. This is recommended as it is exempted from gas fees on the rollup and able to stop other relayers from relaying when it detects a malicious message.

<Warning>
Relayer requires funds to relay messages between Initia L1 and your rollup (if it's not in the fee whitelist). If Weave detects that your account does not have enough funds, Weave will ask you to fund via Gas Station.
</Warning>

## Running Relayer

Currently, Weave generates the relayer configuration file but does not run the relayer directly. You'll need to manually set up and run the Rapid relayer using the generated configuration.

<Note>
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.
