title: Running IBC Relayer
---

An IBC Relayer is required for Enshrined Oracle, Minitswap, and other cross-chain services to function with your Rollup.

While setting up a relayer is traditionally one of the most complex tasks in the Cosmos ecosystem, 
`Weave` simplifies this process significantly, reducing the typical 10+ step IBC Relayer setup to just a few simple steps.

<Warning>
Currently, `Weave` only supports IBC relayer setup between Initial L1 and Interwoven Rollup(s). Setting up relayers between other arbitrary networks is not supported.
</Warning>

<Note>
At present, `Weave` exclusively supports the `Hermes` relayer. For detailed information about Hermes, please refer to the [Hermes documentation](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes).
</Note>

## Setting up IBC Relayer
```bash
weave relayer init
```
When initializing, Weave will present you with three options:
1. Set up a relayer between Initia L1 and a whitelisted Rollup (available in the registry)
2. Configure manually
3. Configure using artifacts from `weave minitia launch` (recommended for users who have just launched their rollup)

<Note>
For advanced configuration options, you can refer to the [Hermes Configuration Guide](https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/configuration/configure-hermes.html) and customize the relayer's configuration file located at `~/.hermes/config.toml`.
</Note>

## Managing Relayer

Start relayer:
```bash
weave relayer start
```

Stop relayer:
```bash
weave relayer stop
```

Restart relayer:
```bash
weave relayer restart
```

View relayer logs:
```bash
weave relayer logs
```

To see all the available commands: 
```bash
weave relayer --help
```
