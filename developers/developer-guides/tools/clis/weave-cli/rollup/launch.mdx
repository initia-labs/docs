title: Launching your Rollup
---

`Weave` simplifies [this lengthy complex rollup deployment process](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/rollup-deployment/introduction) into a single command.

## Launching your Rollup

```bash
weave minitia launch
```
Once the process completes, your minitia node will be running and ready to process queries and transactions.
The command also provides an [Initia Scan](https://scan.testnet.initia.xyz/) magic link that automatically adds your local Rollup to the explorer, allowing you to instantly view your Rollup's transactions and state.

<Note>
This command only sets up the bot addresses but does not start the OPinit Bots (executor and challenger).

To complete the setup, proceed to the [OPinit Bots setup](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/rollup-management/opinit-bots) section to configure and run the OPinit Bots.
</Note>

<Info>
By default, all data and configuration files are stored in `~/.minitia`. You can specify a different location using the `--minitia-dir` flag followed by your preferred path.

## Managing your Rollup node

Start Rollup node:
```bash
weave minitia start
```
<Note>
Note that `launch` command already starts the Rollup node for you. This command is only needed if you have stopped the node and want to start it again.
</Note>

Stop Rollup node:
```bash
weave minitia stop
```

Restart Rollup node:
```bash
weave minitia restart
```

View Rollup node logs:
```bash
weave minitia logs
```

To see all the available commands: 
```bash
weave minitia --help
```
