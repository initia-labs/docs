title: Launching your Rollup
---

Weave simplifies [this lengthy complex rollup deployment process](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups) into a single command.

<Note>
  Weave will send some funds from Gas Station to the OPinit Bot accounts during this process. Please make sure that your Gas Station account has enough funds to cover the total amount of funds to be sent (this amount will be shown to you before sending the funds).
</Note>
<Warning>
  Haven't set up the Gas Station yet? Please [Check out this guide](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/gas-station) first.
</Warning>

```bash
weave rollup launch
```

Once the process completes, your rollup node will be running and ready to process queries and transactions.
The command also provides an [InitiaScan](https://scan.testnet.initia.xyz/) magic link that automatically adds your local rollup to the explorer, allowing you to instantly view your rollup's transactions and state.

<Note>
This command only sets up the bot addresses but does not start the OPinit Bots (executor and challenger).

To complete the setup, proceed to the [OPinit Bots setup](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/rollup/opinit-bots) section to configure and run the OPinit Bots.
</Note>

To launch from the config file without going through the interactive setup process, use the `--with-config` and `--vm` flags.
```bash
weave rollup launch --with-config <path-to-config-file> --vm <move|wasm|evm>
```

**Available Flags**

<ParamField path="--minitia-dir" type="string" default="~/.minitia">
  The directory to store the rollup node data and configuration files.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--with-config" type="string">
  Path to the rollup config file. Use this flag to launch from a config file without going through the interactive setup process.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--vm" type="string">
  The VM to use for the rollup node. The available options are `move`, `wasm`,
  and `evm`. **This is required when `--with-config` flag is provided.**
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--force,-f" type="boolean" default="false">
  Force the launch of the rollup node even if the config file already exists.
  **This only works when `--with-config` flag is provided.**
</ParamField>

## Running your Rollup node

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Start">
    ```bash
    weave rollup start
    ```
    <Note>
      Note that `launch` command already starts the rollup node for you. This
      command is only needed if you have stopped the node and want to start it
      again.
    </Note>
    **Available Flags**
    <ParamField path="--detach, -d" type="boolean" default="false">
      Whether to run the rollup node in the background.
    </ParamField>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Stop">
    ```bash
    weave rollup stop
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Restart">
    ```bash
    weave rollup restart
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="View logs">
    ```bash
    weave rollup log
    ```
    **Available Flags**
    <ParamField path="-n" type="number" default="100">
      The number of lines to display from the end of the logs.
    </ParamField>
  </Tab>
