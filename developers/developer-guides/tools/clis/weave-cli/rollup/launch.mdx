title: Launching your Rollup
---

Weave simplifies [this lengthy complex rollup deployment process](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/rollup-deployment/introduction) into a single command.

```bash
weave rollup launch
```

Once the process completes, your rollup node will be running and ready to process queries and transactions.
The command also provides an [Initia Scan](https://scan.testnet.initia.xyz/) magic link that automatically adds your local rollup to the explorer, allowing you to instantly view your rollup's transactions and state.

<Note>
This command only sets up the bot addresses but does not start the OPinit Bots (executor and challenger).

To complete the setup, proceed to the [OPinit Bots setup](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/rollup-management/opinit-bots) section to configure and run the OPinit Bots.

      again.
