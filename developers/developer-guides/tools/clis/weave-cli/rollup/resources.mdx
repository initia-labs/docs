title: Integration Resources

Once your rollup node is launched and the OPinit bots and IBC Relayer are configured, you can integrate the rollup with various Initia tools. The resources below will help you get started:

- **VM-specific tutorials**
  - [EVM tutorials](/developers/developer-guides/vm-specific-tutorials/evm)
  - [MoveVM tutorials](/developers/developer-guides/vm-specific-tutorials/movevm)
  - [WasmVM tutorials](/developers/developer-guides/vm-specific-tutorials/wasmvm)
- **[Oracle](/developers/developer-guides/tools/oracles/connect/fetching-prices-from-api/getting-single-asset-price)**
- **[Indexer](/developers/developer-guides/tools/indexers/transactions-by-account)**
- **[SDKs](/developers/developer-guides/tools/sdks)**

To have your rollup node appear on **InitiaScan** and the **Initia Wallet widget**, follow:

- **[Initia Registry](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/initia-registry)**

For Bridge integration, register in Initia Registry first, then open a PR that adds your node information to **skip-go-registry** repository.

- **[Skip Go Registry](https://github.com/skip-mev/skip-go-registry)**
