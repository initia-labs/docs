Previously, for your Rollup to be fully operational, 
you need to follow a series of extensive steps (multiple binaries, multiple configuration files, etc.) described [here](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/rollup-deployment/introduction).

Weave CLI simplifies all these steps into a set of easy-to-follow commands, getting your Rollup fully operational in no time.

**For a complete Rollup deployment from scratch, follow these steps in order**. If you only need to set up specific components, you can navigate directly to the relevant sections.

1. [Launch your Rollup and run sequencer/operator node(s)](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/rollup/launch)
2. [Running OPinit Bots (executor and challenger)](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/rollup/opinit-bots)
3. [Running IBC Relayer](/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/weave-cli/rollup/relayer)
