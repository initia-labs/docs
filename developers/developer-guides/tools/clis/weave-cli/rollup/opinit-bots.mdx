title: Running OPinit Bots
---

`Weave` provides a streamlined way to configure and run OPinit Bots (executor and challenger) for your Rollup.
For detailed information about OPinit Bots, please refer to the [OPinit Bots](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/opinit-bots/introduction) documentation.

## Setting up OPinit Bot
```bash
weave opinit-bots init
```
This command will guide you through selecting the bot type (executor or challenger), configuring bot keys if needed, and setting up the bot's configuration.

You can also specify the bot type directly:
```bash
weave opinit-bots init <executor|challenger>
```

<Note>
For advanced configuration options, you can refer to the [Configuration Guide](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/opinit-bots/executor) and modify the bot's configuration file (located at `~/.opinit/<executor|challenger>.toml` by default).
</Note>

<Info>
By default, all data and configurations are stored in `~/.opinit`. You can specify a different location using the `--opinit-dir` flag followed by your preferred path.
</Info>

## Managing Bot Keys
To modify bot keys, use the following command to either generate new keys or restore existing ones:
```bash
weave opinit-bots setup-keys
```
<Warning>
For `executor` bot to work, `Bridge Executor`, `Output Submitter`, and `Batch Submitter` keys must be set up.

For `challenger` bot to work, `Challenger` key must be set up.

For Rollup with Enshired Oracle enabled, `Oracle Executor` key must be set up.
</Warning>
