title: Running OPinit Bots
---

Weave provides a streamlined way to configure and run [OPinit Bots](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/opinit-bots/introduction) (executor and challenger) for your rollup.

## Setting up

```bash
weave opinit init
```

This command will guide you through selecting the bot type (executor or challenger), configuring bot keys if needed, and setting up the bot's configuration.

You can also specify the bot type directly:

```bash
weave opinit init <executor|challenger>
```

**Available Flags**

<ParamField path="--opinit-dir" type="string" default="~/.opinit">
  The directory to store opinit bots data and configuration files
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--minitia-dir" type="string" default="~/.minitia">
  Path to the rollup directory that contains the rollup's artifacts. This is
  useful when you are setting up OPinit bots for a rollup that you have just
  launched, as it can use the artifacts from the rollup to setup the bots.
</ParamField>

<Note>
For advanced configuration options, you can refer to the [Configuration Guide](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/opinit-bots/executor) and modify the bot's configuration file (located at `<opinit-dir>/<executor|challenger>.toml` by default).
</Note>

## Managing Keys

To modify bot keys, use the following command to either generate new keys or restore existing ones:
```bash
weave opinit setup-keys
```

**Available Flags**

<ParamField path="--opinit-dir" type="string" default="~/.opinit">
  The directory to store opinit bots data and configuration files
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="--minitia-dir" type="string" default="~/.minitia">
  Path to the rollup directory that contains the rollup's artifacts. This is
  useful when you are setting up OPinit bots for a rollup that you have just
  launched, as it can use the artifacts from the rollup to setup the bots.
</ParamField>

<Warning>
For `Executor` bot to work, `Bridge Executor`, `Output Submitter`, and `Batch Submitter` keys must be set up.

For `Challenger` bot to work, `Challenger` key must be set up.

For rollups with built-in oracle enabled, `Oracle Executor` key must be set up.
</Warning>

## Resetting OPinit Bots

Reset an OPinit bot's database. This will clear all the data stored in the bot's database (the configuration files are not affected).

```bash
weave opinit reset <executor|challenger>
```
