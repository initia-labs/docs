title: Gas Station
---

The Gas Station is a dedicated account used by Weave to fund critical infrastructure components of the Interwoven stack. It distributes funds to essential services like [OPinit Bots](/nodes-and-rollups/deploying-rollups/opinit-bots/introduction) (including bridge executor, output submitter, and batch submitter) and the [IBC relayer](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/2-cosmos-concepts/13-relayer-intro.html) to ensure smooth operation of the network.

<Note>
  Setting up a Gas Station is essential for seamless operation with Weave as it
  eliminates the need for manual fund distribution.
</Note>

<Warning>
For optimal security, we strongly recommend creating a new dedicated account for Gas Station use rather than using an existing account.

While Weave requires explicit permission for all fund transfers, using a separate account prevents any potential misuse of an existing account.

</Warning>

## Setting up the Gas Station

```bash
weave gas-station setup
```

During setup, you'll be prompted to enter the mnemonic phrase for the Gas Station account. As mentioned above, **we strongly recommend creating a dedicated account for this purpose**.

Once setup is complete, you'll see two addresses in `init` and `celestia` format.

<Note>
  While the Gas Station addresses for Celestia and the Initia ecosystem will be
  different, both are derived from the same mnemonic that you entered.
</Note>

Then fund the account with at least 100 INIT tokens to support the necessary components. If you're planning to use Celestia as your Data Availability Layer, you'll also need to fund the account with `TIA` tokens.

<Info>
  For testnet operations: - Get testnet `INIT` tokens from the [Initia
  faucet](https://faucet.testnet.initia.xyz/) - Get testnet `TIA` tokens from
  the [Celestia
  faucet](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/mocha-testnet#mocha-testnet-faucet)
</Info>

## Viewing Gas Station Information

```bash
weave gas-station show
```

This command displays the addresses and current balances of the Gas Station account in both `init` and `celestia` bech32 formats.
