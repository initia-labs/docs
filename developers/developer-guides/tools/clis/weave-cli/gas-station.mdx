title: Gas Station
---

The Gas Station is a dedicated account used by `Weave` to fund critical infrastructure components of the Interwoven stack. 
It distributes funds to essential services like OPinit bots (including bridge executor, output submitter, and batch submitter) and the IBC relayer to ensure smooth operation of the network.

<Info>
Setting up a Gas Station is recommended and essential for seamless operation with `Weave`, as it eliminates manual fund distribution overhead.
</Info>

<Warning>
For security best practices, creating a dedicated account for Gas Station use rather than using an existing account is recommended. 

While `Weave` requires permission for all fund transfers, a separate account provides better security and operational control.
</Warning>

## Setting up the Gas Station
```bash
weave gas-station setup
```
You will be prompted to enter the mnemonic of the account that will be used as the Gas Station account.
Again, **we recommend creating a dedicated account for this purpose**.

After finishing the setup, fund the Gas Station account with some `INIT` tokens to ensure it has sufficient balance to fund the necessary components.

If you plan to use `Celestia` as your Data Availability Layer, you will need to fund the Gas Station account with `TIA` tokens as well.
<Info>
The Gas Station address for `Celestia` will be different from the one for Initia ecosystem but they are both derived from the same mnemonic.
</Info>

<Info>
For testnet, you can get testnet `INIT` tokens [here](https://faucet.testnet.initia.xyz/) and testnet `TIA` tokens [here](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/mocha-testnet#mocha-testnet-faucet).
</Info>

## Show Gas Station addresses and balances
```bash
weave gas-station show
```
This will display the addresses and balances of the Gas Station account both in `init` and `celestia` bech32 format.
