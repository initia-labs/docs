title: Gas Station
---

The Gas Station is a dedicated account used by `Weave` to fund critical infrastructure components of the Interwoven stack. 
It distributes funds to essential services like OPinit bots (including bridge executor, output submitter, and batch submitter) and the IBC relayer to ensure smooth operation of the network.

<Note>
Setting up a Gas Station is essential for seamless operation with `Weave` as it eliminates the need for manual fund distribution.
</Note>

<Warning>
For optimal security, we strongly recommend creating a new dedicated account for Gas Station use rather than using an existing account. 

While `Weave` requires explicit permission for all fund transfers, using a separate account provides enhanced security and better operational control.
</Warning>

## Setting up the Gas Station
```bash
weave gas-station setup
```
During setup, you'll be prompted to enter the mnemonic phrase for the Gas Station account.
As mentioned above, **we strongly recommend creating a dedicated account for this purpose**.

Once setup is complete, fund the Gas Station account with sufficient `INIT` tokens to support the necessary components.

If you're using `Celestia` as your Data Availability Layer, you'll also need to fund the Gas Station account with `TIA` tokens.
<Note>
While the Gas Station addresses for `Celestia` and the `Initia` ecosystem will be different, both are derived from the same mnemonic phrase.
</Note>

<Info>
For testnet operations:
- Get testnet `INIT` tokens from the [Initia faucet](https://faucet.testnet.initia.xyz/)
- Get testnet `TIA` tokens from the [Celestia faucet](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/mocha-testnet#mocha-testnet-faucet)
</Info>

## Viewing Gas Station Information
```bash
weave gas-station show
```
This command displays the addresses and current balances of the Gas Station account in both `init` and `celestia` bech32 formats.
