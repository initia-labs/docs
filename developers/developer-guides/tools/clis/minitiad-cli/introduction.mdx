## Getting Started

Choose the variant that matches your rollup's VM:

| Wasm | **minitiad** | https://github.com/initia-labs/miniwasm |
| Move | **minitiad** | https://github.com/initia-labs/minimove |

Then install the *minitiad* CLI.

```bash
export VERSION=v1.0.0
git clone https://github.com/initia-labs/minievm.git
cd minievm
git checkout $VERSION

```

If the installation is successful, you should be able to run the following command:

```bash
