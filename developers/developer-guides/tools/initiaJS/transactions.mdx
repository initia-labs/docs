Transaction is a collection of messages that are executed atomically.

To send a transaction, you need to create a transaction object, sign it with your private key, and broadcast it to the blockchain.

This guide will show you how to create and send a transaction using initia.js.

# Transaction Broadcasting

- `createAndSignTx()`: create and sign transaction

```typescript
import { Wallet, LCDClient, MnemonicKey } from '@initia/initia.js'

const key = new MnemonicKey({ mnemonic: 'moral wise ... repair coyote' })
const lcd = new LCDClient('https://lcd.[chain-id].initia.xyz')
const wallet = new Wallet(lcd, key)

const sendMsg = new MsgSend(
    'init14l3c2vxrdvu6y0sqykppey930s4kufsvt97aeu',   // sender address
    'init18sj3x80fdjc6gzfvwl7lf8sxcvuvqjpvcmp6np',   // recipient address
    '1000uinit',                                     // send amount
)

const signedTx = await wallet.createAndSignTx({
    msgs: [sendMsg],
    memo: 'sample memo',
})
```

- `estimateFee()`: simulate the transaction and estimate the gas
```typescript
const fee = await lcd.tx.estimateFee(signedTx)
```

- `broadcast()`: send/broadcast your transaction to the blockchain
```typescript
const broadcastResult = await lcd.tx.broadcast(signedTx)
```
