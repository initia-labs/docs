title: MiniEVM Introduction

## Compatibility

The MiniEVM framework is compatible with all standard EVM developer workflows, tooling, and libraries that developers are already familiar. This includes popular tools like [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), and [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). However, there are minor differences in the way the MiniEVM operates that may require some adjustments to your existing development workflows.

## Changes

### General

**EIP-1559 Transactions**

MiniEVM currently does not support EIP-1559 transactions. This means that when using tools like Foundry to deploy or interact with contracts, or to generally send transactions, you will need to use the legacy transaction type.

### Foundry

**EIP 1559 Transactions**

When using Foundry to deploy or interact with contracts, or to generally send transactions, you will need to use the legacy transaction type. This can be done by using the `--legacy` flag.

**Precompiles and Foundry Scripts**

Foundry's forge script feature always simulates all script transactions on a local standard EVM (without precompiles), and there is currently [no way to skip this simulation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/5776). Consequently, any contract deployment or transaction that relies on MiniEVM precompiles will fail.
