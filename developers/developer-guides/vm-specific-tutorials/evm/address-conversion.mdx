title: Converting Addresses between EVM and Cosmos
---

[Tutorial GitHub Repository](https://github.com/initia-labs/examples/tree/main/evm/address-conversion)

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

## Project Setup

First, we need to create a new directory for our project.

```sh
mkdir address-conversion
cd address-conversion
```

Next, we will initialize the project and installed the `bech32-converting` package.

```sh
npm init
npm install bech32-converting
```

We then create a new file called `index.js` in the `src` directory where we will write our code.

<Note>
You can use any package that allows you to encode and decode bech32-prefixed addresses. However, the specific steps for using those packages may vary.
</Note>

## Development

For this tutorial, we will assume that we have an EVM address `0x0901aeeD1d5144987DaE3D95AB219ff75e9bA636` that we want to convert to a Cosmos address, and then convert it back to an EVM address.

First, we import the `bech32-converting` package and initialize the variable for the chain's Bech32 prefix.

```js src/index.js
const converter = require("bech32-converting")
let bech32Address = "init1pyq6amga29zfsldw8k26kgvl7a0fhf3kftflmr";
```

### EVM Address to Cosmos Address

To convert an EVM address to a Cosmos address, we will be using the `bech32-converting` package's `toHex` function.

```js src/index.js
const hexAddress = converter('init').toHex(bech32Address)
console.log(hexAddress) // 0x0901aeeD1d5144987DaE3D95AB219ff75e9bA636
```

### Cosmos Address to EVM Address

To convert a Cosmos address to an EVM address, we will be using the `bech32-converting` package's `fromHex` function.

```js src/index.js
bech32Address = converter('init').toBech32(hexAddress)
console.log(bech32Address) // init1pyq6amga29zfsldw8k26kgvl7a0fhf3kftflmr
```

The full code for the script is then as follows:

```js src/index.js
const converter = require("bech32-converting")

let bech32Address = "init1pyq6amga29zfsldw8k26kgvl7a0fhf3kftflmr";

const hexAddress = converter('init').toHex(bech32Address)
console.log(hexAddress) // 0x0901aeeD1d5144987DaE3D95AB219ff75e9bA636

bech32Address = converter('init').toBech32(hexAddress)
console.log(bech32Address) // init1pyq6amga29zfsldw8k26kgvl7a0fhf3kftflmr
```

If we run this script, we should see the following output:

```sh
0x0901aeeD1d5144987DaE3D95AB219ff75e9bA636
init1pyq6amga29zfsldw8k26kgvl7a0fhf3kftflmr
```
