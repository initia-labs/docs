To ensure compatibility with Initia's EVM module and the Cosmos SDK in general, ERC20 tokens on Minitias includes certain extensions beyond the standard ERC20 template.

Developers looking to create and deploy ERC20s on EVM Minitias have two options:

1. Deploy Initia ERC20s using the [ERC20Factory](/resources/developer/contract-references/evm/erc20-factory) contract.
2. Extend and modify Initia's [InitiaCustomERC20](/resources/developer/contract-references/evm/initia-custom-erc20) contract.

<Note>
While Initia's `CustomERC20.sol` contains additional logic, it is still fully compatible with the ERC20 standard.
