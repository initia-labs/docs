title: Compiling Modules
---

Once you have created your module, you need to compile it before it can be deployed.

<Steps>
<Step title="Update Move.toml">
Before compiling your module, you need to update the `Move.toml` file to specify the address for your `hello` module. Specifically, this will be the address that you'll use to deploy your module, as well as the address that the module will live under.

To add the `hello` address to your `Move.toml`, modify the `[addresses]` section to include the `hello` address. Your `Move.toml` should look like this:

```toml Move.toml
[package]
name = "hello_world"
version = "0.0.0"

[dependencies]
InitiaStdlib = { git = "https://github.com/initia-labs/movevm.git", subdir = "precompile/modules/initia_stdlib", rev = "main" }

[addresses]
std =  "0x1"
hello = "0x2" # Replace with the deployer address
```

</Step>
  <Step title="Compile Your Module">
  To compile your module, run the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Initia L1
initiad move build
```
```bash Rollups
minitiad move build
```
</CodeGroup>

If successful, you should see the following output:

```bash
Compiling, may take a little while to download git dependencies...
UPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/initia-labs/movevm.git
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY InitiaStdlib
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveNursery
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING hello_world
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the Output">
  After compilation, you should see a new folder called `build` in your project directory. This folder will contain the compiled bytecode for your module, along with other generated files.
