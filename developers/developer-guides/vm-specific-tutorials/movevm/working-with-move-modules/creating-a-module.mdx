title: Creating a Move Module
---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Directory">
  First, we need to create a new directory to house our Move module.
  ```bash
  mkdir hello_world
  cd hello_world
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize a Move Package">
  Once we have our directory created, we can initialize the directory as a Move package.
    <CodeGroup>
```bash Initia L1
initiad move new hello_world
```
```bash Rollups
minitiad move new hello_world
```
</CodeGroup>

Your folder structure should look like this:

```
.
├── Move.toml
└── sources
```

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Move.toml` | The manifest file for the Move package. It contains metadata about the package, including its name, version, dependencies, and other configuration details. |
| `sources` | A directory that contains the Move source code files (`.move` files) for the module(s) in this package. This is where you'll write your Move smart contracts. |

The `Move.toml` file is crucial for managing your Move project, while the `sources` directory is where you'll spend most of your time writing actual Move code. It contains the following information:

1. `name`: The name of the package.
2. `version`: The version of the package.
3. `address`: The list of addresses for the module deployment and dependencies.
4. `dependencies`: The dependencies of the package.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Module">
  Next we will create a new module in the `sources` directory. For this example, we will create a module called `hello_world.move` that contains 2 main functions:
  - Save a string message to the user's account
  - View the saved message from the user's account
  ```move hello_world.move
  module hello::hello_world {
    use std::string::String;

    struct Message has key {
        content: String,
    }

    public entry fun save_message(account: &signer, message: String) {
        let message_struct = Message { content: message };
        move_to(account, message_struct);
    }

    #[view]
    public fun view_message(account: address): String acquires Message {
        borrow_global<Message>(account).content
    }
  }
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
