title: Setting Up
---

For this tutorial, we will mainly be using either the `initiad` CLI if you are developing for the Initia L1 or the `minitiad` CLI if you are developing for MiniMove rollups. If you prefer to interact with the chain from JavaScript/TypeScript instead of the CLI, you can also use InitiaJS SDK.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the CLI or SDK">
First, we need to install the CLI for the network we are working on. The CLI and instructions for installation differ slightly between Initia L1 and MiniMove rollups.

<CardGroup>
<Card title="initiad" href="/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/initiad-cli/introduction">
The CLI for interacting with Initia L1.
</Card>
<Card title="minitiad" href="/developers/developer-guides/tools/clis/minitiad-cli/introduction">
The CLI for interacting with MiniMove rollups.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

Alternatively, if you prefer to interact with the chain from TypeScript instead of the CLI, you can also use the InitiaJS.

</Step>
<Step title="Creating an Account">
Once we have the CLI installed, we can create an account to use for our module.
<CodeGroup>
```bash Initia L1
initiad keys add example
```
```bash Rollups
minitiad keys add example
```
```ts InitiaJS
import { MnemonicKey } from '@initia/initia.js'

const key = new MnemonicKey({
    mnemonic: 'across debate retreat border auction drum inflict demise jaguar fine dizzy absorb general include brush wet exclude host reward post angle shield mouse model',
})

console.log('mnemonic:', key.mnemonic)
console.log('private key:', key.privateKey)
console.log('public key:', key.publicKey)
console.log('account address:', key.accAddress)
```
</CodeGroup>

You should see output similar to the following.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Initia L1
- address: init1ejr270mhdw260hk4ggp4kwmxd20authfag282m
  name: example
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AzBfkuS1ojSqNfqztk34Pn86n7D5MbhKobmsUIN372QG"}'
  type: local


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

account address: init17mq4sqemx2djc59tda76y20nwp4pfn4943x9ze

</Step>
<Step title="Funding Your Account">
Once we have created our account, we can fund it with some tokens. For testnet, you can get testnet tokens from the [faucet](https://faucet.initia.xyz/).
</Step>
</Steps>

Once everything is setup, you're now ready to start developing. In the next section, we will go over how to create, compile, deploy, and interact with a basic Move module.
