title: Updating VIP Scores
---

Changing the scoring scale impacts existing users’ esINIT vesting criteria—**do not change it**.

<Warning>
If you are looking to update the way you score users the flow should be as follows:

1. Post a new Forum post at least 7 days before the update takes place with the updated criteria
    - https://forum.initia.xyz/t/epoch-x-rollup-vip-update/263
2. Post a comment to your original VIP Whitelist Proposal forum post with a link to the new forum post
3. Notify the Initia team that you're updating your score so the VIP Committee may review it
4. The VIP Committee will review and approve it or suggest changes if the update does not follow the VIP criteria
5. Publicly disclose the update to your users in advance of the change on channels such as Discord, X (Twitter), app, etc.

Please note: VIP Scoring is not meant to frequently change as it can alter vesting criteria for users.
