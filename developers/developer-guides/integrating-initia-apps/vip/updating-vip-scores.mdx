title: Updating VIP Scores
---

Changing the way you score users directly affects how much those users unlock their esINIT.
The score feeds into the vesting model, so raising the threshold can reduce the amount of tokens a user receives at their next unlock.
Because this touches token‐vesting commitments that have already been communicated, the scoring scale must remain stable unless a formal amendment is approved.

<Steps title= "How to Propose a Scoring Update">
  <Step title= "Publish a Forum Draft">
    Use the template below to publish a new post describing the change:
    ```
    https://forum.initia.xyz/t/epoch-x-rollup-vip-update/263
    ```
    This link points to the standard template—duplicate it for your own draft.
    Please ensure to post it at least 7 days before the update takes place.
  </Step>
  <Step title= "Comment on Original Proposal">
    In your original VIP Whitelist Proposal thread, add a comment that links to the new draft so readers can follow the discussion.
  </Step>
  <Step title= "Notify the Initia Team">
    Inform the Initia team about your proposed update so the VIP Committee can review it.
  </Step>
  <Step title= "VIP Committee Review">
    The Committee will verify that the update follows the [VIP Scoring Criteria](/home/core-concepts/vip/scoring.mdx#scoring-criteria).
    They may request revisions. Only after they issue an approval should you proceed.
  </Step>
  <Step title= "Public Announcement">
    Announce the update to your users in advance via channels like Discord, X (Twitter), or your app.
    This ensures transparency and prepares users for the changes.

# Why Scoring Should Rarely Change

VIP scoring is the basis for esINIT vesting; frequent tweaks create uncertainty for users and can undermine the credibility of the program.
Reserve changes for clear improvements or to close unanticipated loopholes, and always follow the process above.
