title: Updating VIP Score
---

This phase outlines how to update user VIP scores on-chain, finalize them, and manage the challenge period.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Record VIP scores on-chain">
    Each two-week stage begins with operators continuously updating user scores based on the approved policy.
    Operators can update scores at any time during the stage and should do so as frequently as possible. 
    This allows users to track their VIP scores in real time; not just to catch errors early, but also to monitor their progress, estimate their current rewards, and see how close they are to reaching vesting thresholds.
    Do not change the original scoring scale; any changes would disrupt esINIT vesting ratios and undermine user expectations.
    Make sure to end the stage exactly on the designated end date; delays in finalizing the stage will postpone when users can claim their rewards due to the challenge period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finalize scores">
    When the stage ends, you have a one-hour grace period to seal the data with `finalizeStage`.  
    After this transaction the scores become immutable, the L1 snapshot is submitted, and no further edits are possible.  
    <Warning>
    Double-check every entry before calling `finalizeStage`.  
    If an error slips through, alert the Initia team at once.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Challenge period">
    A three-day challenge period follows finalization.  
    During this time the community may contest mistakes before rewards flow.
    Refer to the [Challenge Period](/home/core-concepts/vip/timelines#challenge-period) for details.
