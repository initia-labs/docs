title: Updating VIP Score
---

This phase outlines how to update user VIP scores on-chain, finalize them, and manage the challenge period.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Record VIP scores on-chain">
    Each two-week stage opens with continuous writing of user scores that follow the approved policy.  
    Operators can update the contract at any time during a stage, enabling users to track their VIP scores in real time and catch errors early.
    Keep the original scoring scale intactâ€”altering it would distort esINIT vesting ratios and invalidate existing user expectations.  
    Be prepared to close the stage promptly on the scheduled date; any delay pushes back user rewards.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finalize scores">
    When the stage ends, you have a one-hour grace period to seal the data with `finalizeStage`.  
    After this transaction the scores become immutable, the L1 snapshot is submitted, and no further edits are possible.  
    <Warning>
    Double-check every entry before calling `finalizeStage`.  
    If an error slips through, alert the Initia team at once.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Challenge period">
    A three-day review window follows finalization.  
    During this time the community may contest mistakes before rewards flow.
