title: Updating VIP Scoring Criteria
---

This guide explains how to update the VIP scoring criteria for a rollup.

<Steps>
  <Step title= "Publish a Forum Proposal">
    Use the provided [proposal template](https://forum.initia.xyz/t/epoch-x-rollup-vip-update/263) to submit forum proposal on the [Initia Forum](https://forum.initia.xyz) outlining the new scoring criteria and the changes. This proposal should be submitted at least one week before the VIP scoring criteria update date to allow the community to review and discuss it.
  </Step>
  <Step title= "Comment on Original Proposal">
    In your original VIP whitelist proposal forum post, add a comment that links to the new draft so community members can follow the discussion.
  </Step>
  <Step title= "Notify the Initia Team">
    Inform the Initia team about your new criteria and share the link to the corresponding forum post so the VIP Committee can review it.
  </Step>
  <Step title= "VIP Committee Review">
    The VIP committee will verify that your new criteria follow the [scoring policy](/home/core-concepts/vip/scoring#scoring-criteria) and is logically sound. If the new scoring criteria meet the requirements, the VIP committee will approve them and notify you.
  </Step>
  <Step title= "Public Announcement">
    After the VIP committee approves the new scoring criteria, announce the changes at least one week before it is implemented to your community. Examples include posting on Discord, X (Twitter), and your other communication channels. The announcement must clearly explain every change, give the exact date and time when the new criteria take effect. It should also link to the forum post and list any actions users must take so they have enough time to prepare.
