title: Updating VIP Scoring Criteria
---

Changing score criteria directly affects how much esINIT a user receives. 
Therefore, when changing the criteria, follow the process outlined below to ensure transparency and maintain user trust.

<Warning>
The vesting of esINIT positions depends on the `minimum_score_ratio`, which is multiplied to the score the users received on each stage. For details on what `minimum_score_ratio` is, see the [maintaining a VIP score](/home/core-concepts/vip/architecture#maintaining-a-vip-score). 
Any significant change to the VIP scoring scale will change the minimum score needed and can impact the vesting of existing esINIT positions.

Suppose the average score in Stage N is 1 000, so the vesting cutoff is 500. If the rollup tightens the formula in Stage N + 1 and the average drops to 10, the new cutoff falls to 5. A user who once earned 600 points may now earn only 6 for the same effort, preventing full vesting. The opposite is just as disruptive: if the scale loosens and the average climbs from 10 to 1 000, users can vest earlier positions with minimal activity.

Significant changes to the scoring scale can make vesting outcomes unpredictable and potentially unfair. When you update your criteria, keep the overall scale intact to prevent unintended consequences.

    In your original VIP whitelist proposal forum post, add a comment that links to the new draft so community members can follow the discussion.
  </Step>
  <Step title= "Notify the Initia Team">
    Inform the Initia team about your new criteria and share the link to the corresponding forum post so the VIP Committee can review it.
  </Step>
  <Step title= "VIP Committee Review">
    The VIP committee will verify that your new criteria follow the [scoring criteria](/home/core-concepts/vip/scoring#scoring-criteria).
    If the new scoring criteria meet the requirements, the VIP committee will approve them and notify you.

  <Step title= "Public Announcement">
    After the VIP committee approves the new scoring criteria, announce the update at least one week in advance by posting on Discord, X (Twitter) and your other communication channels. The announcement must clearly explain every change, give the exact date and time when the new criteria take effect, link to the forum post, and list any actions users must take so they have enough time to prepare.
