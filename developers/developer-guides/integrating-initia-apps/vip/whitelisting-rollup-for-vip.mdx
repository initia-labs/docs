This phase is the **prerequisite** for joining the Vested Interest Program (VIP).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your rollup to the Initia Registry">
    Before a rollup can be whitelisted for VIP, it needs to be first added to the Initia Registry
    Refer to [this page](/developers/developer-guides/integrating-initia-apps/registry/introduction) for more information

    - **`chain.json`**: basic chain information
    - **`profile.json`**: VIP criteria, including metadata about the chain, such as the name, category, and description
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy the VIP Scoring Contract">
    Deploy the appropriate VIP scoring contract for your rollupâ€™s VM.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit a Proposal">
    Before your rollup can be whitelisted, you must open a proposal in the [Initia Forum](https://forum.initia.xyz). 
    In the post, specify the `operator address`, `commission rate`, `VIP score policy` and `VIP scoring contract`, using the [template](https://forum.initia.xyz/t/whitelist-new-rollup-on-vip/146).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the L1 Governance vote">
    After discussion in the forum, submit a governance proposal on Initia L1. Initia team will help with the proposal submission.
    If the community votes **YES**, the rollup is whitelisted for VIP and moves to the Activation Phase. The proposal process will take 7 days.
