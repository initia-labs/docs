title: Whitelisting Rollup for VIP
---

A rollup must be whitelisted before it can participate in the Vested Interest Program (VIP).

<Note>
Mainnet rollups must submit a proposal and participate in a governance vote to be whitelisted for VIP. For testnet rollups, you can contact the Initia team to get your rollup whitelisted for VIP.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your rollup to the Initia Registry">
    Add the rollup to the [Initia Registry](https://github.com/initia-labs/initia-registry) before requesting VIP whitelisting. Refer to [this page](/developers/developer-guides/integrating-initia-apps/registry/introduction) for more information on how to add your rollup to the Initia Registry. When you add your rollup to the Initia Registry, you must create or update the following files in your pull request.

    - **`chain.json`** contains metadata about the chain, such as its name, chain ID, and network type, which is essential for users to interact with the chain.
    - **`profile.json`** contains metadata about the chain, such as its name, category, and description. This information helps users understand the chain's purpose and includes details relevant to the VIP program, such as actions users can take to earn VIP rewards.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy the VIP Scoring Contract">
    Deploy the appropriate VIP scoring contract for your rollupâ€™s VM.
      - EVM: https://github.com/initia-labs/vip-score-evm
      - Wasm: https://github.com/initia-labs/vip-score-wasm
      - Move: https://github.com/initia-labs/vip-score-move
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit a Forum Proposal">
    Before your rollup can be whitelisted, you must create a proposal in the [Initia Forum](https://forum.initia.xyz). In the proposal, specify the `operator address`, `commission rate`, `VIP score policy`, and `VIP scoring contract`, using the [template](https://forum.initia.xyz/t/whitelist-new-rollup-on-vip/146). `operator address` is the address that will receive the operator commission, and you must create it before submitting the proposal. `commission rate` is the percentage of the total VIP rewards that the operator will receive. `VIP score policy` is the scoring criteria that will be used to calculate the VIP scores for users on your rollup. The policy must follow the [VIP Criteria & Scoring Policies](/home/core-concepts/vip/scoring#vip-criteria-%26-scoring-policies). `VIP scoring contract` is the address of the deployed VIP scoring contract, and you need to specify the contract address in the proposal. For details on how to deploy the VIP scoring contract, see the [Integrating VIP](/developers/developer-guides/integrating-initia-apps/vip/integrating-vip) guide.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit a L1 Governance Proposal">
    After creating the forum proposal, you can submit the L1 governance proposal for VIP whitelisting as follows.
    
    ```ts vip-l1-gov-proposal.ts
    import { MnemonicKey, RESTClient, Wallet, bcs, MsgSubmitProposal, MsgGovExecute } from '@initia/initia.js'

    const MNEMONIC_KEY = process.env.MNEMONIC_KEY || 'castle lung ...' // Your wallet's mnemonic key
    const REST_URL = process.env.REST_URL || 'https://rest.initia.xyz' // Initia L1 REST endpoint

    const VIP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
      process.env.VIP_CONTRACT || 'init182yxkv4gqfvz7tjyde6dfgjdr4ldqxklgmf23aju2u3cslnss7ys6dy6w8'                         // Rollup's VIP contract address
    const OPERATOR_ADDRESS =
      process.env.OPERATOR_ADDRESS || '0x68b8295438b3d50f81679db88260a596b8ab1f4be1caa94af87c6b853baf7b20'                  // Rollup's VIP operator address
    const BRIDGE_ID = process.env.BRIDGE_ID || '16'                                                                         // Bridge ID
    const BRIDGE_ADDRESS = process.env.BRIDGE_ADDRESS || 'init1y3avrs2r9q3ggj5xs2q5zg4mmpqvr2necwl6s6fhfergtyp93ueq5270ht'  // Bridge address
    const L2_SCORE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = process.env.L2_SCORE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS || '0x668dc438bd71f365d1e9ae39ac92f35d5ccde03d' // L2 score contract address
    const OPERATOR_COMMISSION_MAX_RATE = process.env.OPERATOR_COMMISSION_MAX_RATE || '0.2'                                  // Operator commission max rate, e.g., 0.2 for 20%
    const OPERATOR_COMMISSION_MAX_CHANGE_RATE = process.env.OPERATOR_COMMISSION_MAX_CHANGE_RATE || '0.2'                    // Operator commission max change rate, e.g., 0.2 for 20%
    const OPERATOR_COMMISSION_RATE = process.env.OPERATOR_COMMISSION_RATE || '0.2'                                          // Operator commission rate, e.g., 0.2 for 20%
    const PROPOSAL_METADATA = process.env.PROPOSAL_METADATA || 'https://forum.initia.xyz/t/whitelist-echelon-on-vip/62/1'   // VIP proposal forum URL
    const PROPOSAL_TITLE = process.env.PROPOSAL_TITLE || 'Whitelist Echelon on VIP'                                         // VIP proposal title
    const PROPOSAL_SUMMARY = process.env.PROPOSAL_SUMMARY || 'This proposal is to whitelist Echelon on Initia VIP program.' // VIP proposal summary
    const ROLLUP_VM_TYPE = process.env.ROLLUP_VM_TYPE || 0                                                                  // Rollup VM type, 0 for MoveVM, 1 for WasmVM, 2 for EVM

    async function main() {
      const key = new MnemonicKey({ mnemonic: MNEMONIC_KEY })
      const rest = new RESTClient(REST_URL, {
        gasPrices: `0.015uinit`
      })
      const wallet = new Wallet(rest, key)

      const msg = new MsgSubmitProposal(
        [
          new MsgGovExecute(
            'init10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j55nka3',
            VIP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
            VIP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
            'vip',
            'register',
            [],
            [
              bcs.address().serialize(OPERATOR_ADDRESS).toBase64(),
              bcs.u64().serialize(BRIDGE_ID).toBase64(),
              bcs.address().serialize(BRIDGE_ADDRESS).toBase64(),
              bcs.string().serialize(L2_SCORE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS).toBase64(),
              bcs.bigdecimal().serialize(OPERATOR_COMMISSION_MAX_RATE).toBase64(),
              bcs.bigdecimal().serialize(OPERATOR_COMMISSION_MAX_CHANGE_RATE).toBase64(),
              bcs.bigdecimal().serialize(OPERATOR_COMMISSION_RATE).toBase64(),
              bcs.u64().serialize(ROLLUP_VM_TYPE).toBase64()
            ]
          )
        ],
        '100000000uinit',
        wallet.key.accAddress,
        PROPOSAL_METADATA,
        PROPOSAL_TITLE,
        PROPOSAL_SUMMARY,
        false
      )

      const tx = await wallet.createAndSignTx({ msgs: [msg] })
      const result = await rest.tx.broadcast(tx)
      console.log('Transaction result:', result)
    }

    main().catch(console.error)
    ```  

  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the L1 Governance vote">
    Once the community approves a rollup whitelisting, the Initia team will create a governance proposal on Initia L1 like [this example](https://scan.initia.xyz/interwoven-1/proposals/27). If the proposal passes after the voting period, the rollup will be whitelisted for VIP.
