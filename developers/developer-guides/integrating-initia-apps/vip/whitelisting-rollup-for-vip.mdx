title: Whitelisting Rollup for VIP
---

Whitelisting a rollup is a prerequisite for joining the Vested Interest Program (VIP).

<Note>
Submitting a proposal and governance vote is only required for Mainnet rollups.

For testnet rollups, you can contact the Initia team to get your rollup whitelisted for VIP.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your rollup to the Initia Registry">
    Before a rollup can be whitelisted for VIP, it needs to be first added to the [Initia Registry](https://github.com/initia-labs/initia-registry).
    
    Refer to [this page](/developers/developer-guides/integrating-initia-apps/registry/introduction) for more information on how to add your rollup to the Initia Registry.

    - **`chain.json`** contains metadata about the chain, such as its name, chain ID, and network type, which is essential for users to interact with the chain.
    - **`profile.json`** contains metadata about the chain, such as its name, category, and description. This information helps users understand the chain's purpose and includes details relevant to the VIP program, such as actions users can take to earn VIP rewards.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy the VIP Scoring Contract">
    Deploy the appropriate VIP scoring contract for your rollupâ€™s VM.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit a Proposal">
    Before your rollup can be whitelisted, you must create a proposal in the [Initia Forum](https://forum.initia.xyz). 
    
    In the proposal, specify the `operator address`, `commission rate`, `VIP score policy`, and `VIP scoring contract`, using the [template](https://forum.initia.xyz/t/whitelist-new-rollup-on-vip/146).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the L1 Governance vote">
    Once the community approves a rollup whitelisting, the Initia team will create a governance proposal on Initia L1 like [this example](https://scan.initia.xyz/interwoven-1/proposals/27).
    
    If the proposal passes after the voting period, the rollup will be whitelisted in VIP.
