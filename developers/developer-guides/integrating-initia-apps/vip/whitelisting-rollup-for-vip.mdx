title: Whitelisting Rollup for VIP
---

Whitelisting rollup is the prerequisite for joining the Vested Interest Program (VIP).

<Note>
Submitting a proposal and governance vote is only required for mainnet rollups.

For testnet rollups, you can contact the Initia team to get your rollup whitelisted for VIP.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your rollup to the Initia Registry">
    Before a rollup can be whitelisted for VIP, it needs to be first added to the [Initia Registry](https://github.com/initia-labs/initia-registry).
    
    Refer to [this page](/developers/developer-guides/integrating-initia-apps/registry/introduction) for more information on how to add your rollup to the Initia Registry.

    - **`chain.json`** contains metadata about the chain, such as the chain name, chain ID, and network type. This information is essential for users to interact with the chain
    - **`profile.json`** contains metadata about the chain, such as the name, category, and description. This information is used to provide users with a better understanding of the chain and its purpose. Additionally, it contains details according to the VIP program, including actions that users can take to earn VIP rewards

  <Step title="Deploy the VIP Scoring Contract">
    Deploy the appropriate VIP scoring contract for your rollupâ€™s VM.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit a Proposal">
    Before your rollup can be whitelisted, you must create a proposal in the [Initia Forum](https://forum.initia.xyz). 
    
    In the proposal, specify the `operator address`, `commission rate`, `VIP score policy` and `VIP scoring contract`, using the [template](https://forum.initia.xyz/t/whitelist-new-rollup-on-vip/146).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the L1 Governance vote">
    Once the community approves a rollup whitelisting, the Initia team will create a governance proposal on Initia L1 like [this example](https://scan.initia.xyz/interwoven-1/proposals/27).
    
    If the proposal passes after the voting period, the rollup will be whitelisted in VIP.
