### What is Initia Wallet?

Initia Wallet is a React library that provides components and hooks to connect dApps to Initia and Interwoven Rollups.

### Why use this?

- User interface to connect external wallets
- User inferface to fetch assets, NFTs, and activity by account address, and to send assets
- User interface to trigger bridge and swap, onboarding from other chains to the rollup
- Functions to estimate gas fees, request signing from connected wallets, and poll for results

### Compatibility with EVM-Based Chains

- It uses the widely adopted [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) library. Therefore, users can [send transactions via JSON RPC through wagmi](./integration/evm) instead of the provided interface or [choose to use RainbowKit for wallet connection](./integration/rainbowkit).
- Still, interfaces for querying assets across interwoven rollups or onboarding via bridges will be useful.
