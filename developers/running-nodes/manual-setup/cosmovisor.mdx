To help simplify the process of automatically switching the `initiad` application binary versions during chain upgrades, we recommend using the [Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor) tool. 

To install Cosmovisor, follow the instructions on the [Cosmovisor Cosmos SDK documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.45/run-node/cosmovisor.html).
