Enshrined Liquidity is Initia’s solution to address some of the inherent challenges of the [Proof of Stake](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-proof-of-work-or-proof-of-stake) (PoS) and [rollup](https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/what-are-blockchain-rollups-a-full-guide-to-zk-and-optimistic-rollups#:~:text=Blockchain%20Rollups%20are%20an%20L2,are%2C%20and%20how%20they%20work.) models. These challenges include:

1. Tradeoffs between chain security and liquidity
2. Lack of <Tooltip tip="The ratio between the amount of assets invested and the received returns"> capital efficiency </Tooltip>
3. <Tooltip tip="The available liquidity being spread thin across multiple venues rather than being accessible from a single marketplace"> Liquidity Fragmentation </Tooltip>

This is done by allowing governance-whitelisted InitiaDEX INIT-TOKEN liquidity positions to also be used as staking assets with validators, in addition to the native INIT token. This helps alleviate the above issues in the following ways.

## Maximizing Chain Security and Liquidity

In traditional PoS models, token holders can stake their assets with validators to secure the chain and earn rewards. However, this creates a tradeoff: the more assets staked, the more secure the chain, but fewer assets are available as liquidity within the application layer. This tradeoff impacts both chain security and liquidity.

By enabling liquidity positions to be staked, users can simultaneously increase the chain’s security and promote liquidity growth while earning rewards from both staking and liquidity provision.

## Enhancing Capital Efficiency

From a user perspective, having to choose between staking assets and providing liquidity also means sacrificing either trading fees or staking rewards. Users aiming to earn both rewards then needs to split their capital into multiple positions, reducing their overall capital efficiency.

By being able to used liquidity positions as staking assets, Enshrined Liquidity eliminates the need to choose between staking and liquidity provision. Users can now earn both staking rewards and trading fees from a single position, leading to improved capital efficiency and a streamlined approach to capital allocation for all stakeholders.

## Central Hub of Liquidity

By unlocking capital efficiency and maximizing available liquidity, Enshrined Liquidity establishes a central liquidity hub for the Initia ecosystem. This enhanced liquidity streamlines interactions with the Initia L1 and L2 chains. For example, by aggregating liquidity across various minitias, the InitiaDEX can facilitate and simplifies transfers and swaps between assets across multiple minitias, improving the overall user experience within the ecosystem.
