title: InitiaDEX

The Initia L1 DEX is the cornerstone of liquidity within the Initia ecosystem. It features a [Balancer](https://balancer.fi)-style weighted pool for diverse asset pairs and a [StableSwap](https://docs.curve.fi/references/whitepapers/stableswap/) pool for assets with closely correlated prices, ensuring an optimal trading experience across various asset types.

In addition to its role as a central source of liquidity for the ecosystem, the InitiaDEX is also a critical component that drives the growth, stability, and alignment of the entire Initia ecosystem. This is currently accomplished in two main ways:

- [**Enshrined Liquidity**](/home/getting-started/enshrined-liquidity/introduction.mdx): Optimizing liquidity and chain security through allowing whitelisted InitiaDEX liquidity positions to be used as staking assets for the Initia L1.
- [**Minitswap Pool Type**](/home/getting-started/minitswap/introduction): A custom pool type designed to alleviate the friction and challenges posed by the long withdrawal times of [optimistic bridges](https://medium.com/connext/optimistic-bridges-fb800dc7b0e0).

These two features are explored in more details in the following sections.
