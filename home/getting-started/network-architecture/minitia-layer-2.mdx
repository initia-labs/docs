## Highly Secure

Minitias leverage the Initia L1 for security-related functions such as governance, transaction finalization, and fraud prevention. This approach ensures a high level of security for users without the need for separate security infrastructure.

## Multiple VM Support

The Minitia architecture supports multiple virtual machines, including [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/), [MoveVM](https://aptos.dev/en/network/blockchain/move), and [WasmVM](https://cosmwasm.com). Developers can choose the VM that best fits their preferences and use cases.

## High Scalability

Minitia rollups framework enhance the Cosmos SDK to deliver high-performance, scalable, and secure transaction and smart contract execution. With 500ms block times, Minitias ensure responsiveness for all users. Additionally, block times are elastic, slowing down during off-peak periods to minimize minitia node resource consumption when there are no transactions.

## Fully Interoperable

Minitias leverage the [IBC Protocol](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev) for seamless bridging with other Cosmos SDK chains. All minitias are also automatically integrated with major interoperability solutions such as [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) and USDC's [CCTP](https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol).

## Natively Integrated

Minitias benefit from a suite of natively integrated solutions and products:

- **Initia's Product Suite:** Full native support by Initia's product suite, including the Initia App, Initia Wallet, Initia Usernames, and Initia Scan, ensures an optimal user experience.
- **Native USDC and Fiat On-ramps:** Access to native USDC through [Noble](https://nobleassets.xyz) and [Kado](https://kado.money)'s fiat gateways provides easy onboarding for users.
- **Programmable Mempool and Blocks:** Minitias integrate [Skip](https://skip.money)'s [Block SDK](https://skip-protocol-docs.netlify.app/blocksdk/overview/) toolkit, giving developers maximum control over block production and transaction processing.

Minitias are Layer 2 application chains within the Initia ecosystem, functioning as fully operational CosmosSDK blockchains that utilize optimistic rollups for settlement. With rapid 500ms block times and the capacity to handle over 10,000 transactions per second, Minitias are high-performance platforms for a wide array of applications.

## Aligned Incentives

To align incentives among a minitia, its users, the Initia L1, and the broader ecosystem, qualified minitias can receive a portion of the total INIT supply. This rewards users for key actions that benefit their application and encourages long-term alignment with the Initia ecosystem.
