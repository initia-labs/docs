The Initia Platform is composed of three integral components:

## 1. The Initia Orchestration Layer (Initia L1)

Initia L1 is a Layer 1 blockchain designed to serve as the coordination layer and central hub for all Initia Rollups (Minitias). This layer provides essential services to Minitias, including:

- **Network Security**
- **Consensus Mechanism**
- **Governance**
- **Interoperability**
- **Liquidity Solutions**
- **Bridging and Cross-Chain Messaging**

## 2. The Initia Rollups (Minitias)

Minitias are an ecosystem of Layer 2 blockchains built atop Initia L1, offering a scalable and secure infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps). Developers have the flexibility to deploy and customize their own Minitias, tailoring various aspects such as:
- **Smart Contract Virtual Machine (VM)**
- **Gas Tokens**
- **Other Customizable Features**

## 3. Connecting the Components: The OPInit Stack

The OPInit Stack is a custom optimistic rollup framework specifically designed for Cosmos SDK chains within the Initia Ecosystem. It plays a crucial role in:
- Securely coordinating the security and governance of the Initia Rollups
- Ensuring a seamless experience for users by faciliating token transfers and other cross chain interactions
