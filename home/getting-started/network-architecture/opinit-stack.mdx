title: OPInit Stack
---

The OPInit Stack is Initia's implementation of the [Optimistic Rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/) framework to provide coordination, security, and interoperability between the Initia L1 and minitias. It is also the primary way in which the minitias communicate, transact, and is secured by the Initia L1.

Integrated into both chains's design, the OPInit Stack powers various Initia-native features including

- **Asset Bridging:** The OPInit Stack's optimistic bridge is used as the INIT token's primary bridge between the Initia L1 and minitias
- **Fraud Proofs and Challenges:** To secure the minitia users against malicious operators, the OPInit Stack enables minitias to utilize the Initia L1 governance system for resolving fraud-proof disputes.
- **Data Availability:** The OPInit Stack features built-in integrations with both the Initia L1 and Celestia as [data availability](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/data-availability-blockchain-crypto) layers. This ensures that the minitias state data is always up-to-date and accessible to others for security purposes.
