title: EVM Compatibility

## Compatibility

The MiniEVM framework is compatible with all standard EVM developer workflows, tooling, and libraries that developers are already familiar. This includes popular tools like [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), and [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). However, there are minor differences in the way the MiniEVM operates that may require some adjustments to your existing development workflows.

## Changes

### General

**EIP-1559 Transactions**

MiniEVM currently does not support EIP-1559 transactions. This means that when using tools like Foundry to deploy or interact with contracts, or to generally send transactions, you will need to use the legacy transaction type.

### Cosmos SDK Integrations

#### Token Representation

By default, any new Cosmos coins created on the chain, whether they are fee denomination tokens, tokens minted via IBC, or other tokens created at genesis will also have an ERC20 representation on the MiniEVM. This allows developers and users to interact with these tokens using both the Cosmos Coin interface and messages, as well as the EVM ERC20 interface.

#### Fee Tokens

While the Cosmos SDK and Minitia design supports multiple fee denominations on a single network, the MiniEVM's EVM module uses a single fee token denomination for all transactions. This denomination must be one of those set on the Cosmos side.

Once set, the EVM fee denomination effectively becomes the equivalent of native tokens (e.g. ETH) on other EVM networks. This denomination will then be used for transaction fees sent via the EVM's JSON-RPC, as well as for any funds attached to EVM transactions via `msg.value`.

However, as mentioned above, unlike other EVM networks, the MiniEVM's native token is also represented by an ERC20 interface. This means that for any transaction or logic, you can also interact with it using the ERC20 interface.

## Tool Compatibility

### Foundry

**EIP 1559 Transactions**

When using Foundry to deploy or interact with contracts, or to generally send transactions, you will need to use the legacy transaction type. This can be done by using the `--legacy` flag.

**Precompiles and Foundry Scripts**

Foundry's forge script feature always simulates all script transactions on a local standard EVM (without precompiles), and there is currently [no way to skip this simulation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/5776). Consequently, any contract deployment or transaction that relies on MiniEVM precompiles will fail.
