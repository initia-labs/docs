## Overview

The Initia L1 is a foundational piece and the base layer of the rollups and the Interwoven Stack that provides **security**, **liquidity**, **interoperability**, and **incentives** for the rollups. It's designed as a custom blockchain based on the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network) with [CometBFT](https://docs.cometbft.com) consensus.

- **Security:** The rollups utilize the Initia L1 and the network's validators for security in various ways. Firstly, when bridging INIT tokens from the L1 to rollups via the OPinit Bridge, the INIT tokens are locked in a module on the L1. The rollups also use the L1 as the settlement layer to submit state transitions to the L1 for finality.
- **Liquidity:** The [InitiaDEX](/home/core-concepts/initiadex) on the L1 acts as a central hub for liquidity for the rollups. It enables the rollups to build up and incentivize liquidity for their tokens, and utilize that liquidity for various purposes such as cross-rollup bridging and swaps, or to use them in their own applications
- **Interoperability:** The L1 acts as a central hub and router for the rollups. By establishing a single connection to the L1, rollups now have the ability to communicate and interact with the L1, other rollups, as well as other chains in the wider blockchain ecosystem.
- **Incentives:** The L1 powers various incentive schemes that are accessible to all rollups. These includes the Vested Interest Program (VIP) that enables rollups to incentivize its users to perform actions that are maximally beneficial to their application, and the Enshrined Liquidity program that incentivize users to provide liquidity to the InitiaDEX for various uses.
