## Overview

The Initia L1 is a foundational piece and the base layer of the Minitias and the Interwoven Stack that provides **security**, **liquidity**, **interoperability**, and **incentives** for the Minitias. It is designed as a custom blockchain based on the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network) with [CometBFT](https://docs.cometbft.com) consensus.

- **Security:** The Minitia rollups utilize the Initia L1 and the network's validators for security in various ways. Firstly, when bridging INIT tokens from the L1 to minitias via the OPinit Bridge, the INIT tokens are locked in a module on the L1. The rollups also use the L1 as the settlement layer to submit state transitions to the L1 for finality.
- **Liquidity:** The [InitiaDEX](/home/core-concepts/initiadex) on the L1 acts as a central hub for liquidity for the Minitias. It enables the Minitia to build up and incentivize liquidity for their tokens, and utilize that liquidity for various purposes such as cross-Minitia bridging and swaps, or to use them in their own applications
- **Interoperability:** The L1 acts as a central hub and router for the Minitias. By establishing a single connection to the L1, Minitias now have the ability to communicate and interact with the L1, other Minitias, as well as other chains in the wider blockchain ecosystem.
- **Incentives:** The L1 powers various incentive schemes that are accessible to all Minitias. These includes the Vested Interest Program (VIP) that enables Minitias to incentivize its users to perform actions that are maximally beneficial to their application, and the Enshrined Liquidity program that incentivize users to provide liquidity to the InitiaDEX for various uses.
