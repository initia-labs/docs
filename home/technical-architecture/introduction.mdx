## Architecture Overview

The Initia ecosystem is built around a robust rollup architecture, comprising four key components:

1. **[Initia L1](/home/core-concepts/initia-and-rollups/initia-l1)**: The foundational Layer 1 blockchain that provides essential services for rollups, including:
    - Security
    - Liquidity
    - Incentives
    - Interoperability

2. **[Rollups](/home/core-concepts/initia-and-rollups/rollups)**: Individual Layer 2 rollups that leverage Initia L1's services to enhance their specific applications and use cases.

3. **[OPinit Bot](/home/core-concepts/interwoven-stack/opinit-framework)**: A set of processes responsible for:
    - Relaying deposits
    - Submitting outputs
    - Transmitting oracle data between Initia L1 and rollups

4. **[Celestia](https://celestia.org/)**: The primary Data Availability layer for rollups

## The Interwoven Stack

These core components, along with various services, applications, and tools, form the [**Interwoven Stack**](/home/core-concepts/interwoven-stack/introduction). This comprehensive ecosystem provides a robust foundation for decentralized applications and services.

In the following sections, we'll delve deeper into each component of the Interwoven Stack, exploring their individual roles and how they contribute to the overall architecture.
