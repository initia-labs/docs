To handle and execute actions related to the OPinit Bridge, we have created the OPinit Bot Executor. This executor is responsible for: 

- **Executing Token Transfers:** Executing token transfers between Initia L1 and Minitias
- **Submitting Output Proposals:** Submitting output proposals to the Initia L1
- **Transaction Batch DA Submission:** Submitting Minitia transaction batches to the DA layer
- **Relaying Oracle Update (Optional):** Relaying oracle price feed updates to the Minitias

The full flow for these actions is outlined in the [following section](/initia-and-minitias/technical-architecture/opinit-framework/action-flows).
