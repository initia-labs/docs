The OPinit Framework consists of thre main components: the OPinit Bridge, the Executor, and the Challenger.

## OPinit Bridge

The [OPinit Bridge](/home/technical-architecture/opinit-framework/components/opinit-bridge) is a set of Cosmos SDK modules that enable the transfer of INIT and other tokens between the Initia L1 and Minitia L2 using an optimistic bridge model.

## OPinit Bots

The OPinit Bots are a set of processes responsible for executing and monitoring the various actions necessary to operate and secure the Minitia. Currently, there are two bots in this system: the Executor and the Challenger.

### Executor

The [Executor](/home/technical-architecture/opinit-framework/components/executor) is a set of processes responsible for executing the various actions necessary to operate and secure the Minitia. These include:

-  **Token Transfers**: The Executor handles the OPinit Bridge token deposits and withdrawals between Initia L1 and the various Minitias.
-  **Output Submission**: The Executor submits the Minitia's transaction outputs to the Initia L1 to finalize the Minitia's state.
-  **DA Batch Submission**: The Executor submits the Minitia's transaction batches to the Celestia DA layer.
-  **Oracle Data**: The Executor can be configured to relay the Slinky oracle price data on the Initia L1 to the Minitia L2 for its applications to use.

### Challenger

The [Challenger](/home/technical-architecture/opinit-framework/components/challenger) is a process separate from the Executor, responsible for monitoring the Executor's output proposals and challenging any invalid proposals. This helps maintain the integrity of the Minitia's state and ensures that the Executor is not acting maliciously.
