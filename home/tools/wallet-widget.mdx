One of the barriers for users to onboard into a new ecosystem has always been the need to download, install, and use a new wallet. The Initia Wallet Widget solves this by allowing users to connect and use their existing EVM-compatible wallets to interact with applications on Initia and all Interwoven Rollups, regardless of the VM or smart contract language they use.

- For users, they just need to click "Connect Wallet" and then select their preferred wallet, just like they do on any other chain or applications
- For developers, the Wallet Widget is a simple and lightweight library that can be easily integrated into any application.
