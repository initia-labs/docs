The [Initia Bridge](https://bridge.initia.xyz) allows users to transfer tokens between the Initia L1, all Interwoven Rollups, and other ecosystems. Utilizing Skip Go API's routing, the Bridge aggregates various bridging protocols such as LayerZero, CCTP, IBC, and the Interwoven Stack's native optimistic bridge to provide the best price and the fastest route for users. By further combining this with various DEXs including Initia DEX, the Bridge enables users to also perform swaps as part of their bridging process, all in 1 user action. This enables various use cases and flows, including:

1. Bridging and swapping from USDC on Ethereum to INIT on Initia L1 (via CCTP, IBC, and Initia DEX)
2. Bridging and swapping from ETH on Optimism to Kamigotchi (via LayerZero and IBC)
3. Instantly bridging INIT from an Interwoven Rollup to Initia L1 (via IBC and Minitswap)
