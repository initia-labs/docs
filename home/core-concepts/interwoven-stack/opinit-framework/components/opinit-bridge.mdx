title: OPinit Bridge
---

## Overview

The OPinit Bridge is an implementation of the optimistic rollup bridge, implemented as two Cosmos SDK modules:

-  **OPchild Module**
-  **OPhost Module**

## OPhost Module

The OPhost Module is embedded into the Initia L1 chain. This module is responsible for:

-  **Bridge Management:** Creating, updating, and managing bridges between Initia L1 and rollups.
-  **Output Proposal Handling:** Managing and finalizing L2 output proposals.

## OPchild Module

The OPchild Module acts as a counter-party to the OPhost Module and is integrated into all rollup implementations. This module is responsible for:

-  **Operator Management:** Adding, removing, and managing operators for a given rollup.
-  **Bridge Message Execution:** Processing messages received from the Initia L1.
-  **Oracle Updates:** Managing oracle price feed updates relayed by the OPinit Executor.

Actions related to these two modules are normally handled by the [OPinit Bot Executor](/home/core-concepts/interwoven-stack/opinit-framework/components/executor).
