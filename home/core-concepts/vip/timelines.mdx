## Timelines

### Gauge Voting Cycles

The Vested Interest Program always begins with a [gauge voting](/home/core-concepts/vip/gauges) cycle. During this cycle, Initia L1 stakers vote on the gauge weights that will determine the VIP [Weight Pool](/home/core-concepts/vip/architecture#weight-pool) rewards distribution for the next rewards stage.

### Reward Distribution Stages

After the first gauge voting cycle concludes, the first reward distribution stage begins. During a stage, the individual rollup teams will begin to keep track of scores for all of their users based on their scoring criteria.

During a stage, the snapshot of each rollup's INIT balance will also be taken and used to determine the VIP [Balance Pool] rewards. There are two ways the snapshot is done:

1.  **For Stage 1**: Two snapshots are taken: a single snapshot at the beginning of the stage to determine the VIP Balance Pool rewards for Stage 1, and multiple snapshots throughout the stage to determine the VIP Balance Pool rewards for Stage 2+.
2.  **For Stage 2+**: Multiple snapshots are taken throughout the stage to determine the VIP Balance Pool rewards for the next stage.

At the end of the stage, the scores for each user on each rollup are finalized, and the final rewards are distributed to the users.

The combined timelines of the the gauge voting cycle and rewards distribution stage then as follows:

### Challenge Period

When a rollup finalizes its scores, the rollup enters a **72-hours challenge period**. During the challenge period, the community may audit the yet-to-be-settled scores, and may propose a replacement before all rewards for a rollup is finalized in the case of wrong score submission. 

For example: Rollup A submits and finalizes its scores on **Jan 1, 10:00UTC** â†’ the challenge period ends on **Jan 4, 10:00 UTC.**

#### Submitting a Challenge

A challenge may be submitted via an expedited or emergency governance proposal on Initia L1, since a normal 7-day governance proposal will not pass within the 72 hours of challenge period. 

#### Required Parameters

The below parameters must be included in a challenge

```
bridge_id:           u64,        // Target rollup
challenge_stage:     u64,        // Stage being challenged
new_api_uri:         string,     // Endpoint serving proofs for original and new scores
new_agent:           address,    // Replacement scoring agent
new_merkle_root:     vector<u8>, // Merkle root of replacement score set
new_l2_total_score:  u64         // Aggregate L2 score for the stage
```

`new_api_uri` **must** return Merkle proofs for both the original scores and the proposed replacement.

#### Outcome of a Successful Challenge

1. Scoring agent is replaced - the authority is transferred to a `new_agent`.
2. Merkle root is updated - `new_merkle_root` becomes canonical, and rewards for the stage are recalculated.

This mechanism provides a fast and transparent safeguard against any erroneous or malicious score submissions without delaying the overall VIP timelines.
