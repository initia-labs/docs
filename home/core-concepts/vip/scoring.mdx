title: VIP Scoring

## Introduction

The VIP Program employs a scoring system designed to allocate ‚Å†esINIT rewards to users. This system evaluates users based on their activities and contributions within a specific rollup. The specific scoring policy varies between each rollup, and the scoring process is conducted on-chain directly by the respective rollup team. These 

### Scoring Phase

First, during each epoch, rollup teams score their users based on their activity through a `vip_score` contract. 

To score users, the rollup operator must first register the `deployer` account on the `vip_score` contract using their operator key. Once registered, the deployer can add and remove user scores based on the determined criteria. See [this page](/developers/developer-guides/integrating-initia-apps/vip) for more information on how scoring works. All future scoring actions can only be performed by the deployer until they are changed or removed.

Once the scoring for an epoch is complete, the scores must be finalized by calling a function on the `vip_score` contract.

<Warning>
The VIP scoring system is designed to encourage usage of the rollup, its application, and its economy. Any misuse of the VIP scoring system will result in the rollup being removed from the VIP program. This includes, but is not limited to using VIP scores to:
- give rewards directly to the rollup operator, team, or their associated accounts
- incentivize activities like holding, staking, LPing for a project's token or NFT
- incentivize users to vote for the rollup on VIP Gauges
</Warning>

### Snapshotting Phase

Once finalized, the VIP Agent snapshots and submits the scores from all miniatures, storing them in the Initia L1 VIP module. The Agent is an actor selected through Initia L1 governance. After all snapshots have been taken and stored, the esINIT rewards are distributed to the users.

### Claiming Phase

Finally, the user can finally claim the distributed rewards.
