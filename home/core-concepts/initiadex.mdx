The InitiaDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Initia L1. It serves as a Balancer-style weighted pool for diverse asset pairs and a StableSwap pool for assets with closely correlated prices. This design ensures an optimal trading experience across various asset types.

The DEX aims to be the central liquidity hub for all Interwoven Rollups, facilitating daily trading and more complex cross-rollup interactions and swaps. The InitiaDEX is essential for promoting the growth, stability, and alignment of the entire Initia ecosystem.

To support these goals, the DEX features [Enshrined Liquidity](home/core-concepts/enshrined-liquidity/introduction). This allows certain liquidity pairs, whitelisted by the Initia L1 governance, to be used as staking assets for the Initia L1.
