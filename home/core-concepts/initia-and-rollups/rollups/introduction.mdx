Interwoven Rollups are Layer 2 rollups built using Initia's [Interwoven Stack](/home/core-concepts/interwoven-stack/introduction). These rollups are designed to be scalable, highly interoperable, and fully customizable.

- **Virtual Machines**: Rollup teams can choose between EVM, Move, or Wasm as the virtual machine for their rollup to best suit their application and needs
- **Gas Tokens & Fees**: Each rollup can choose its own gas token and fee structure. This can include INIT, stablecoins, their native token, or even multiple tokens.
- **Transaction Ordering**: If needed, rollups can also implement their own transaction ordering mechanism.
