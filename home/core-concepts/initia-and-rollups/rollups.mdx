## Overview

Rollups on Initia are high-performance, customizable blockchains. Leveraging the Initia L1 for security, liquidity, interoperability, and incentives, Initia rollups offer a secure, scalable, and user-friendly environment for a wide range of applications and use cases. With these rollups, rollup developers and teams can benefit from:

- **High Customizability:** Developers and teams building on rollups can easily customize various aspects of the rollup, such as the virtual machine, gas token configuration, and more.
- **Fastest Time-to-Market:** Traditionally, deploying a rollup involves much more than just deploying the rollup itself. Teams needs to spend time and efforts on building, choosing, and  integrating peripheral services and products like wallets, explorers, bridges, and more. Through the Interwoven Stack, rollup developers already have access to all these services and products out of the box.
- **Natively Interoperable:** All rollups are natively supported and integrated into various major bridging and interoperability protocols, including OPinit, IBC, CCTP, and LayerZero. This ensure that rollups can easily connect and interact with other blockchain ecosystems and protocols.
- **Enhanced Security:** Rollups inherently leverages the Initia L1 and its validator set for security. Through integration with Celestia DA layer, anyone can also leverage the data posted to the DA layer to verify the validity of rollup transactions.
