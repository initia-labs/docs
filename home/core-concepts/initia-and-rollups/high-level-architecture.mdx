title: High Level Architecture
---

Initia's architecture is composed of three main components:

- **Initia L1**: The Initia L1 is the base layer and central liquidity hub for all Interwoven rollups
- **Interwoven Rollups**: An ecosystem of blockchain rollups built atop Initia L1
- **Interwoven Stack**: Initia's framework for easily and painlessly building rollups and applications

## Components

### Initia L1

Initia L1 is a Layer 1 blockchain designed to serve as the coordination layer and central hub for all Initia rollups. This layer provides essential services to Rollups, including:

- Network Security
- Governance
- Liquidity Solutions
- Bridging and Interoperability

### Interwoven Rollups

Interwoven Rollups are an ecosystem of Layer 2 blockchains built atop Initia L1, offering a scalable, customizable, and secure infrastructure for any application. Developers have the flexibility to deploy and customize their own rollup, tailoring various aspects such as:

- Smart Contract Virtual Machine
- Gas Tokens
- Other Customizable Features

### The Interwoven Stack

The [Interwoven Stack](/home/core-concepts/interwoven-stack) is Initia's framework for building rollups and applications. It offers a seamless, integrated experience for developers.

The Stack aims to simplify the process of building and operating blockchain applications by providing native, out-of-the-box solutions for common tasks. All the tools and features that appchain developers typically need are built directly into the core Interwoven Stack, making them accessible from day one.

By reducing choice overload, Initia minimizes fragmentation and allows teams to concentrate on creating the best applications.
