## Overview

The Initia L1 is a custom-built Layer 1 blockchain that serves as the central coordination layer for all Interwoven Rollups. The L1 is built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network) and is responsible for:

1. **Security**: Rollups leverage Initia L1's security for various purposes including token bridging, state commitments, and fraud proofs
2. **Liquidity**: The [InitiaDEX](/home/core-concepts/initiadex) on L1 acts as a central liquidity hub for the ecosystem, providing a seamless experience for token liquidity and cross-rollup bridging and swaps
3. **Interoperability**: L1 functions as a central hub and router for rollups, enabling seamless communication and state transitions both between rollups and with the broader blockchain ecosystem
4. **Incentives**: L1 powers various incentive schemes including the [Vested Interest Program (VIP)](/home/core-concepts/vested-interest-program/introduction) and the [Enshrined Liquidity](/home/core-concepts/enshrined-liquidity/introduction)
