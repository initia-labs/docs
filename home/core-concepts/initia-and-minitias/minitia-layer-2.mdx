## Overview

Minitias are Initia's high-performance, customizable rollup chains. Leveraging the Initia L1 for security, interoperability, incentives, and more, Minitias offer a secure, scalable, and user-friendly environment for a wide range of applications and use cases. With Minitias, rollup developers and teams can benefit from:

- **High Customizability:** Developers and teams building on Minitias can easily customize various aspects of the Minitia, such as the virtual machine, gas token configuration, and more.
- **Fastest Time-to-Market:** Traditionally, deploying a rollup involves much more than just deploying the rollup itself. Teams needs to spend time and efforts on building, choosing, and  integrating peripheral services and products like wallets, explorers, bridges, and more. Through the Interwoven Stack, Minitia developers already have access to all these services and products out of the box.
- **Natively Interoperable:** All Minitias are natively supported and integrated into various major bridging and interoperability protocols, including OPinit, IBC, CCTP, and LayerZero. This ensure that Minitias can easily connect and interact with other blockchain ecosystems and protocols.
- **Enhanced Security:** Minitias inherently leverages the Initia L1 and its validator set for security. Through integration with Celestia DA layer, anyone can also leverage the data posted to the DA layer to verify the validity of rollup transactions.
