title: High Level Architecture
---

The Initia Platform is composed of three integral components:

- Initia L1: The Initia L1 is the coordination layer and central hub for all Initia Rollups (Minitias).
- Minitias: Minitias are an ecosystem of blockchain rollups built atop Initia L1, offering a scalable and secure infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps).
- The Interwoven Stack: The Interwoven Stack is Initia's framework for easily and painlessly building rollups and applications

## Components

### The Orchestration Layer (Initia L1)

Initia L1 is a Layer 1 blockchain designed to serve as the coordination layer and central hub for all Initia Rollups (Minitias). This layer provides essential services to Minitias, including:

- **Network Security**
- **Consensus Mechanism**
- **Governance**
- **Interoperability**
- **Liquidity Solutions**
- **Bridging and Cross-Chain Messaging**

### The Rollups (Minitias)

Minitias are an ecosystem of Layer 2 blockchains built atop Initia L1, offering a scalable and secure infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps). Developers have the flexibility to deploy and customize their own Minitias, tailoring various aspects such as:
- **Smart Contract Virtual Machine (VM)**
- **Gas Tokens**
- **Other Customizable Features**

### Connecting the Components: The Interwoven Stack

The [**Interwoven Stack**](/home/core-concepts/interwoven-stack) is Initia's framework for building rollups and applications on top of the Initia L1. The framework is designed to provide a seamless and integrated experience for developers, with a focus on scalability, security, interoperability, and ease of development and operation for blockchain applications.

The Stack aims to reduce the complexity of building and operating blockchain applications by providing native, out-of-the-box solutions for common blockchain tasks. With these, rollup application developers can focus on building innovative applications.
