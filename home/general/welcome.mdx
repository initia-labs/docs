Initia's core philosophy is to make opinionated decisions on the underlying infrastructure such as data availability, interoperability, and oracles. By reducing decision fatigue, the Interwoven Stack empowers developers with the tools to craft application-specific environments while maintaining un-fragmented accessibility to the application ecosystem.
