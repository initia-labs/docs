## Building a Network for Interwoven Rollups

Initia is a network for interwoven optimistic rollups; we are holistically **rebuilding how the multichain system should look, feel, and operate**.

Initia accomplishes this by innovations in 3 main areas; infrastructure, products, and economics. Through a customized Initia Layer 1 blockchain and a proprietary rollup framework, the Interwoven Stack, Initia ensures that rollups and application teams

- have all all the pieces to build a secure, performant, and customizable rollup
- can focus on building their application and have all the tools necessary ready since day 1
- are incentivized and are strongly aligned with the success of the overall network
