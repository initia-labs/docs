The Initia L1 is a custom-built Layer 1 blockchain built on top of the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network). The L1 serves as the coordination hub for all rollups and offers various crucial services.

1. **Security**: Rollups leverage Initia L1 and its validator network for secure token bridging and as a settlement layer for state transitions.
2. **Liquidity**: The [InitiaDEX](/home/primitives/initia-dex/initia-dex) on L1 acts as a central liquidity hub for rollups, a platform for building and incentivizing token liquidity, and a facilitator for cross-rollup bridging and swaps.
3. **Interoperability**: L1 functions as a central hub and router for rollups, allowing the rollups to connect and communicate with each other and other ecosystems through LayerZero, CCTP, and IBC.
4. **Incentives**: L1 powers various incentive schemes, including the [Vested Interest Program](/home/primitives/vested-interest-program) (VIP) which encourages user actions beneficial to rollup applications, and the Enshrined Liquidity program which incentivizes liquidity provision to InitiaDEX.
