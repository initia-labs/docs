title: Introduction
---


Once the minitia is running and we have established the initial connections, we now need to set up the OpInit bots. These bots will perform various tasks, and there are currently 4 in total:

- **Bridge Executor:** Executes bridge transactions
- **Output Submitter:** Submits minitia transaction output state roots to the Initia L1
- **Batch Submitter:** Submits minitia transaction batches to either the Initia L1 or Celestia
- **Challenger**: Monitors the minitia output submissions and prevent invalid proposals from being finalized

For more information on what each individual bot and process does as well as on the OPinit stack in general, see [this]() section.

<Warning>
For convenience, OPinit bots can be hosted on the same machine as your minitia service for testing purposes. 

However, for production and mainnet instances, we recommend hosting your OPinit bots on separate machines, distinct from the machine hosting your minitia service.

## Install Dependencies

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Install NodeJS" icon="node-js">
The reference OPinit bots are written in JavaScript and requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+).

To install Node, follow the instructions on the [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

To verifiy that NodeJS is successfully installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion
  title="Install Postgres"
  icon="database"
>
The OPinit bot utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve different operational information.

To install PostgreSQL, follow the instructions on the PostgreSQL website.

To verify that PostgreSQL is successfully installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
psql --version
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setting Up the Database

Once PostgreSQL is installed, we proceed to creating the database that will be used by our OPinit Bots for transaction and other tracking data on both the minitia and Initia L1.

```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE minitia   # rename the database as desired
```

## Install OPinit Bots

Next, you can download and, depending on whether you're using the Docker image or the source code, build the OPinit bot codebase.

<CodeGroup>
```sh Source Code
git clone https://github.com/initia-labs/OPinit-bots.git
cd OPinit-bots
npm install
npm run build
```
```sh Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/initia-labs/opinit-bots:v0.1.16
```
</CodeGroup>

## Environment Variables Files

Each OPinit bot relies on a separate `.env` file to configure its parameters. These files will be named in the format `.env.{BOT_NAME}`. The directory in which to place these files may vary depending on how you're running the bots.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Source Code">
Inside the `OPinit-bots` directory, run the following commands to create the environment variable files

```sh
cd OPinit-bots
touch .env.executor
touch .env.batch
touch .env.challenger
touch .env.output
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Docker">
When running OPinit bots through the Docker container, the .env files can be placed anywhere on your machine and then referenced separately when running each bot. However, we recommend creating a dedicated directory to store all of it.

```sh
mkdir opinit-bots-env
cd opinit-bots-env
touch .env.executor
touch .env.batch
touch .env.challenger
touch .env.output
```
