title: Introduction

Once the minitia is running and we have established the initial connections, we now need to set up the OpInit bots. These bots will perform various tasks, and there are currently 2 in total:

- [Executor](/initia-and-minitias/deploying-minitias/opinit-bots/executor.mdx)
- [Challenger](/initia-and-minitias/deploying-minitias/opinit-bots/challenger.mdx)

For more information on what each individual bot and process does as well as on the OPinit stack in general, see this section.

<Warning>
For convenience, OPinit bots can be hosted on the same machine as your minitia service for testing purposes. 

However, for production and mainnet instances, we recommend hosting your OPinit bots on separate machines, distinct from the machine hosting your minitia service.
</Warning>


## Install Dependencies

Before running OPinit bots, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Go 1.22.2+

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build and Configure">

    To build and configure the bots, follow these steps:

    ```bash
    make install
    opinitd init [bot-name]
    ```

    Default config path is `~/.opinit/[bot-name].json`

    You can register keys using the following command:

    ```bash
    opinitd keys add [chain-id] [key-name]
    ### with mnemonic file
    opinitd keys add [chain-id] [key-name] --recover --source [mnemonic-file-path]
    ### with mnemonic input
    opinitd keys add [chain-id] [key-name] --recover
    ### with bech32 prefix
    opinitd keys add [chain-id] [key-name] --bech32=celestia
    ```
    These keys will be used for the bot to sign transactions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Bot">
    To start the bot, use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    opinitd start [bot-name]
    ```

    The following options can be set:

    - `--log-level`: log level can be set. Default log level is `info`.
    - `--polling-interval`: polling interval can be set. Default polling interval is `100ms`.
    - `--config`: config file name can be set. Default config file name is `[bot-name].json`.
    - `--home`: home dir can be set. Default home dir is `~/.opinit`.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Reset Bot DB

To reset the bot database, use the following command:

```bash
opinitd reset-db [bot-name]
```
