## Set up Dependencies

Before running OPinit bots, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- [Go 1.22.2+](https://go.dev/doc/install)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build opinitd">
    To build the `opinitd` binary, use the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/initia-labs/opinit-bots.git
    cd opinit-bots
    make install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Bot">
    To initialize the OPinit bots, follow these steps:
    ```bash
    opinitd init executor
    ```
    
    Default config path is `~/.opinit/executor.json`
    You can register keys using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    opinitd keys add [chain-id] [key-name]
    ### with mnemonic file
    opinitd keys add [chain-id] [key-name] --recover --source [mnemonic-file-path]
    ### with mnemonic input
    opinitd keys add [chain-id] [key-name] --recover
    ### with bech32 prefix
    opinitd keys add [chain-id] [key-name] --bech32=celestia
    ```
    
    These keys will be used for the bot to sign transactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Run Executor

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build opinitd">
    To build the `opinitd` binary, use the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/initia-labs/opinit-bots.git
    cd opinit-bots
    make install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Executor Bot">
    To initialize the Executor bot, use the following command:
    ```bash
    opinitd init executor
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title= "Configuration">
    To configure the Executor, fill in the values in the `~/.opinit/executor.json file`.
    ```json executor.json
    {
      "version": 1,
      "listen_address": "localhost:3000",
      "l1_node": {
        "chain_id": "testnet-l1-1",
        "bech32_prefix": "init",
        "rpc_address": "tcp://localhost:26657",
        "gas_price": "0.15uinit",
        "gas_adjustment": 1.5,
        "tx_timeout": 60
      },
      "l2_node": {
        "chain_id": "testnet-l2-1",
        "bech32_prefix": "init",
        "rpc_address": "tcp://localhost:27657",
        "gas_price": "",
        "gas_adjustment": 1.5,
        "tx_timeout": 60
      },
      "da_node": {
        "chain_id": "testnet-l1-1",
        "bech32_prefix": "init",
        "rpc_address": "tcp://localhost:26657",
        "gas_price": "0.15uinit",
        "gas_adjustment": 1.5,
        "tx_timeout": 60
      },
      "output_submitter": "",
      "bridge_executor": "",
      "max_chunks": 5000,
      "max_chunk_size": 300000,
      "max_submission_time": 3600,
      "l2_start_height": 0,
      "batch_start_height": 0
    }
    ```
    - `version`: Indicates the version of the OPinit spec (basically 1).
    - `listen_address`: The address where the Challenger bot listens for incoming requests.
    - `l1_node`: Information about the L1 node, including chain ID and RPC address.
    - `l2_node`: Information about the L2 node, including chain ID and RPC address.
    - `da_node`: Information about the DA node (mainly L1 or Celestia), including chain ID and RPC address.
    - `output_submitter`: The key name in the keyring for the output submitter.
    - `bridge_executor`: The key name in the keyring for the bridge executor.
    - `max_chunks`: The maximum number of chunks in a batch.
    - `max_chunk_size`: The maximum size of a chunk in a batch.
    - `max_submission_time`: The maximum time to submit a batch.
    - `l2_start_height`: Executor automatically sets the starting height for output proposal based on this value. If set to 0, the bot will start from the latest block height.
    - `batch_start_height`: Executor automatically sets the starting height for batch submitting based on this value. If set to 0, the bot will start from the latest block height.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Bot">
    To start the bot, use the following command:
    ```bash
    opinitd start executor
    ```

    The following options can be set:

    - `--log-level`: log level can be set. Default log level is `info`.
    - `--polling-interval`: polling interval can be set. Default polling interval is `100ms`.
    - `--config`: config file name can be set. Default config file name is `[bot-name].json`.
    - `--home`: home dir can be set. Default home dir is `~/.opinit`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Query

You can query the Executor bot to get its status or view the withdrawal information:

### Status

You can query the Executor bot to get its status:

```bash
curl localhost:3000/status
```

```json
{
  "bridge_id": 1,
  "host": {
    "node": {
      "last_block_height": 0,
      "broadcaster": {
        "pending_txs": 0,
        "sequence": 0
      }
    },
    "last_proposed_output_index": 0,
    "last_proposed_output_l2_block_number": 0
  },
  "child": {
    "node": {
      "last_block_height": 0,
      "broadcaster": {
        "pending_txs": 0,
        "sequence": 0
      }
    },
    "last_updated_oracle_height": 0,
    "last_finalized_deposit_l1_block_height": 0,
    "last_finalized_deposit_l1_sequence": 0,
    "last_withdrawal_l2_sequence": 0,
    "working_tree_index": 0,
    "finalizing_block_height": 0,
    "last_output_submission_time": "",
    "next_output_submission_time": ""
  },
  "batch": {
    "node": {
      "last_block_height": 0,
    },
    "batch_info": {
      "submitter": "",
      "chain_type": ""
    },
    "current_batch_file_size": 0,
    "batch_start_block_number": 0,
    "batch_end_block_number": 0,
    "last_batch_submission_time": ""
  },
  "da": {
    "broadcaster": {
      "pending_txs": 0,
      "sequence": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### Withdrawals 

To finalize a token withdrawal, the withdrawal information is required.

Executor bot can provide withdrawal information for a given sequence:

```bash
curl localhost:3000/withdrawal/{sequence} | jq . > ./withdrawal-info.json
initiad tx ophost finalize-token-withdrawal ./withdrawal-info.json --gas= --gas-prices= --chain-id= --from=
```


## Reset Bot DB

If the database becomes corrupted or is moved to a new one, you need to initialize or reset it.

To reset the bot database, use the following command:

```bash
opinitd reset-db executor
```
