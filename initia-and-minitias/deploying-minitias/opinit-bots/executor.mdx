title: Executor
---

The Executor is responsible for

1. relaying L1 token deposit transactions to L2 and periodically submitting L2 output roots to L1.
2. relaying L1 oracle data to L2.
3. submitting L2 block data to DA.
4. providing withdrawal proofs for user's token withdrawals.

## Initialize Executor Bot

To initialize the Executor bot, use the following command:

```bash
opinitd init executor
``` 

## Configuration

To configure the Executor, fill in the values in the `~/.opinit/executor.json file`.

```json executor.json
{
  // Version is the version used to build output root.
  "version": 1,
  // ListenAddress is the address to listen for incoming requests.

}
```

## Start Bot
