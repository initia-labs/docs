title: MiniMove Introduction

## Overview

The MiniMove is a [MoveVM](https://move-language.github.io/move)-based variant of Initia's Minitia rollup framework, designed to support deployment and interaction with MoveVM smart contracts.

Specifically, our MoveVM is based on the [Aptos variant](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts) of the MoveVM, with additions and changes to improve performance and enable compatibility with the Minitia's underlying Cosmos SDK stack and the wider Initia ecosystem.
